# E-bikes are a Transportation Revolution
I bought an e-bike in November, it was life-changing, and I quickly bought two more.

I've incepted friends and family with e-bike mania and am overwhelmed with e-bikes' potential to improve the lives of millions of people who don't realize it yet.

I'm documenting my journey – and reflections about the e-bike space – here, in the hope it will help others.

## Background: Bike-sharer → Bike-owner → E-bike maniac <a id="background"></a>
The COVID "bike boom" hit me hard:
- **2012 → July 2020**:
  - Enthusiastic bike-share ([Citibike NYC][citibike]) user.
  - Frequently: take train to a place/event, bike home; 1-way option is nice!
  - The bikes are heavy and slow, but convenient.
- **July 2020**:
  - Got a hand-me-down roadbike.
  - "I still love Citibike, but this is much better for some trips/errands."
  - (As you will see, I have become a firm believer in "different bikes for different trips" 😂)
- **September**:
  - Need something for the grocery run.
  - Bought a "hybrid" (non-electric; [a cross between "road" and "mountain"; basically a "city bike"][hybrid]). Revelatory, love it.
  - Got [lots of bags+accessories](#gear) to fit different needs (errands/cargo, distance/joy-ride, day in the city, etc.)
- **November 2020**:
  - I'd still like to try an e-bike.
  - Ideally it will haul even more cargo, and also fold up for easy storage (my office already has two drywall-mounted bikes and e-bikes are generally too heavy for that).
  - Bought a [Tern Vektron Q9][Q9] (folding + cargo bike).
- **December → January 2021**:
  - E-bikes are revolutionary and I need more 🤩.
  - Helping friends+family try+buy.
  - Market moving so quickly; so many fascinating takes on what an "electric bike" is and can be.
  - Bought [an electric roadbike][Creo] and a [VanMoof X3][X3] (all-purpose city e-bike).

[![Home office with 2 bikes hanging on walls and one bike folded on ground](https://p199.p4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/OAuWd8eA/3f6c62d2-cd07-4df4-bb86-71d5164c4715.jpg?v=81611949ce3a4f2c6d934b673464e063)](https://share.getcloudapp.com/OAuWd8eA)
TODO: pic w/ all 5 bikes

## E-bike Inventory <a id="my-ebikes"></a>
My current e-bikes are:
1. [Tern Vekton Q9][Q9]: large cargo capacity, folds up for easy storage, one size fits all.
2. [VanMoof X3][X3]: great all-around / "city bike" / starter/lender for newcomers. One size fits all, automatic shifting, "turbo" button for quick starts.
3. [Specialized Creo][Creo]: electric road-bike; light and fast, long range.

Each is useful in different contexts, and together they cost less than half [the $40k average new car in the US](#cost) (see below for [starter packs in the $2k-$4k range](#starter-packs), or 1/20th to 1/10th the avg new car price).

I'll probably end up with 1 or 2 more. I want the ability to take people+cargo on rides that would otherwise require an SUV (and which would still be worse in various ways, and cost even more).

### VanMoof X3 <a id="x3-review"></a>
- Excellent all-around / starter e-bike
- You may want to be within range of a VanMoof shop, and prepared to lean on them to fix things that come up.

#### Automatic Shifting <a id="x3-shifting"></a>
The automatic gear shifting weirded me out at first (especially because I was temporarily in a very hilly place when I took delivery of it). My advice about it is:
- Use the turbo button liberally on uphills, and when starting from a stop!
- The gears shift based on your speed (not cadence, or torque).
  - In the beginning I got frustrated not knowing why it wasn't shifting, or when it would, as I spun the pedals or slowed toward a stop up a hill.
  - I spent some time in the app micro-managing what speed it would shift into which gear at. After a bunch of thrashing, I think I ended up back at almost exactly the factory defaults 😂 (having also learned the glory of the turbo button).

#### Reliability / Shop Proximity <a id="x3-reliability"></a>
A common refrain on [r/vanmoof] is that you should be prepared to take it to the shop for tune-ups or major issue troubleshooting.

I've had to go in once because we transferred ownership of the bike between VanMoof accounts, and it ended up stuck in "EU mode" with a top speed of 20kph (instead of the US's 20mph). It was easy enough and fun to see the shop, etc., though obviously you'd rather the bike Just Work. I feel I can endorse the lifestyle where you just buy the theft+maintenance plan and enjoy a peace of mind back-stop to how wrong things could go with the bike.

#### Shipping <a id="x3-shipping"></a>
I've observed them to quote a 2-3mo timeframe for shipping, only to have the bike show up in a couple weeks!

## Revelations <a id="revelations"></a>
E-biking has brought a string of revelations about my city, cities in general, mobility as a fundamental human need and right, [turbulent flows][cgp-grey-traffic], and more. Here are some things that have struck me in learning to get around by (e)bike:

### Speed ⟹ Safety <a id="speed-safety"></a>
It's counterintuitive, but having access to more speed (and acceleration) makes you dramatically safer on a bike. Starting from a stop at lights, holding a lane on shared roads, minimizing the number of cars that close on and overtake you (and the speed they overtake you at)… you are much more in control of your relationship to traffic on an ebike. This is one of new e-bikers' biggest "💡"/"🤯" moments.

It's also surprising how a little boost makes a *big* difference in that feeling of control and safety. Moving top speed from 15mph to 20mph means a car going 25mph *passes you half as quickly* and *has twice as much time to "see you coming" as it comes up behind you*.

In more typical urban settings where cars might be averaging 15mph (between 0 and 20mph due to mild congestion and lights), it means you can find one driver who:
1. sees you
2. is not telegraphing their desire to murder you

and draft them for a while (until the next light, when you must bid them "🙏", glide up to the front, and find a new host).

You basically had to be a professional cyclist to access this ability to simply exist on car-dominated roads, but now almost everyone can.

### Speed ⟹ Inclusion <a id="speed-inclusion"></a>
The Speed⟹Safety effect is particularly true for people who are not stereotypic young/fit men (women, children of all ages, older people, differently abled people, …). I was brave enough – [some of the time][near-misses] – to bike around NYC before e-bikes, but it was not feasible for my wife (though she is in her 30's and reasonably athletic). This was due to the high baseline level of bullying from drivers (both inadvertent and intentional) as well as specific vitriol and threats she received as a woman taking space that some men motorists feel is theirs.

- TODO: other gender ridership: citibike
- TODO: historical bike feminism

### Speed ⟹ Convenience <a id="speed-convenience"></a>
The most obvious benefit of speed is that it lets you get from A to B faster (or for less work, at a given speed). Less worry about getting sweaty or feeling like getting home is daunting or you're not up for it. Generally easier to go places and do things.

[Class 1 e-bikes][ebike-classes] provide a pedal-assist up to 20mph; this lets casual riders (who normally top out at 12-15mph) play in the 15-20mph range and, as with [the "safety" angle](#safety-speed), that ≈30% difference actually makes for a qualitatively different experience. I consistently pass more cars than pass me now (except *sometimes* if I'm along the West Side Highway for long enough 😂). It's pretty hard to go 15-20mph in a car for very long in urban environments, so for a large class of trips.

This is a brand new, developing mode of transportation that changes the basic math of transportation in cities; [my "Favorite Rides" section](#favorite-rides) has some examples and discussion of this.

### Cost <a id="cost"></a>
On average, [a new car in the US costs $40k][new-car-cost]; [owning+operating a car costs $800/month][car-cost-800-mo].

Lots of the US effectively levies a $40k tax to participate in society, which hits the least well off the hardest.

[80% of car trips are under 5mi][car-trip-length] and easily replaceable by a luxurious e-bike kit – including [gear and accessories to the max](#gear) – that costs 1/10th what a car costs.

#### 1 car ⟹ 10 e-bikes + gear
When I am passing cars stuck in traffic, one of the saddest things is that each of those cars could have paid for 10 families' e-bike mobility solutions™️.

Some of the darkest images of the failed state of American governance as well as transportation culture were the long lines of cars at food banks during COVID lockdowns:

[![overhead shot of cars in line at a San Antonio food bank in April 2020, from Reuters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109445173-001d0f00-7a0d-11eb-9d7d-b8c58162dc22.png)
](https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/long-lines-at-food-banks-across-us-idUSRTX7EHU2)

[![overhead shot of cars in line at a San Diego food bank in April 2020, from ABC News](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109445290-44101400-7a0d-11eb-868c-38545f594874.png)](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/covid-19-crisis-heaps-pressure-nation-s-food-banks-n1178731)

We've struggled and failed to give people $2k of COVID relief, but have designed a society where they must spend $800/mo on the least efficient mode of transportation.

You can get a full starter ebike package with racks and gear for hauling, for under $2k; [see my $3k VanMoof starter pack sketch below](#x3-pack). With financing comparable to what people get for cars, that's maybe $60/mo. My 3 e-bikes are significantly up-market from where most ppl will start, and they'd be $250/mo. (including [a huge variety of gear and accessories](#gear)).

### Space <a id="space"></a>
E-bikes take up very little space for the mobility they provide. Mode shift from private cars to e-bikes directly improves a large class of congestion and parking issues.

Taking up less space also means you can bring your bike with you on other modes when necessary (trains, buses, even ride-shares), store it easily, etc.

#### Bike vs. Car Storage <a id="bike-vs-car-storage"></a>
A critical area where American cities fail in enabling biking – and especially e-biking – is providing secure bike parking infrastructure.

[Oonee][oonee] (pronounced "uni") is an NYC-based startup I'm obsessed with that operates [phone-unlocked pods near transit where a dozen bikes can be stored][oonee pod], and is piloting ["mini" pods that replace single-car parking spots w/ secure storage of 6-10 (e-)bikes][oonee mini].

For comparison, here are some examples of bike parking in other countries that would be a nightmare if replaced with car-parking:

Compare to car-centric American analogs:

### Cargo <a id="cargo"></a>
E-bikes can replace cars for a surprising variety of cargo-hauling tasks:

#### Groceries, Bulk Items <a id="groceries"></a>
There is a small (but growing), dedicated group of people that love to show off the things they haul on their (e-)bikes, that I recommend checking out (images link to tweets):

[![Tern GSD with a huge amount of groceries on the front and back](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109440506-854df700-7a00-11eb-8474-d96342f7828c.png)

#### Kids <a id="kids"></a>
Even my X3 (VanMoof's smallest bike) supports [a Yepp child seat][yepp-maxi] (the most popular brand I see used):

![VanMoof X3 with a child seat on the back](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109441255-c6dfa180-7a02-11eb-9b73-d177896842be.png)

Larger bikes can fit 2 on the back easily:

[![Woman biking in heels with two children facing each other and playing "patty cake" on the back of the bike](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109443060-99e1bd80-7a07-11eb-97b7-98d079e9c2e8.png)
](https://twitter.com/christineadair/status/1289669201674690560)

There are also front-loading options:

![Woman cargo-biking in NYC with 2 children in a bakfiet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109441210-9f88d480-7a02-11eb-90a3-90065b0b3b85.png)

[![Cargo bike carrying three children and their bikes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109442955-643cd480-7a07-11eb-8097-677d2e7491ad.jpeg)](https://twitter.com/genepedia/status/1272606386401079296)

Of course, it's possible to do even more with less:

![Woman biking with 4 children on a bicycle – 2 in front, 2 in back](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109441501-61d87b80-7a03-11eb-96d8-46d06703c398.png)

but luckily, new and evolving e-bike technology is making all configurations much, much easier.

Finally, most children are capable of biking themselves to school at a relatively young age, if we kept them safe from drivers; see [re-thinking the school run][school-run] for more discussion.

#### PoV: Grocery Runs <a id="pov-grocery-runs"></a>
My grocery runs since getting an e-bike have also been so surprising and delightful that [I've been documenting them in an album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ASed6bguwTXAXSxt8):

![Groceries on counter-top: bread, soup, sauce, vegetables, cheeses](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109439533-aca2c500-79fc-11eb-926d-4f2cf9689af1.png)
*Farmer's market runs 🙏🙏*

*and it folds!*

![Groceries on counter-top: 3 12-packs of sparkling water, 3 half-gallons of juice, and a dozen random items](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109439274-afe98100-79fb-11eb-8ba6-c08ffa51ade3.png)

*Sometimes you just have a craving… or 7*

#### PoV: Moving house <a id="pov-moving-house"></a>
Recently, I moved to my brother's empty apartment for 9d (after a small-chance of COVID exposure, to avoid any risk of exposing my wife).

I packed a comfortable >1wk vacation into 4 bags (2 [panniers](#panniers), 1 bag in front rack, 1 backpack), and [biked, ferried, and biked from Jersey City to the Flatiron][strava-vanmoof-move]:
[![VanMoof X3 with two panniers, small tube bags, and tote bag in front rack](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109439794-ca245e80-79fd-11eb-8133-22e50555080d.png)][strava-vanmoof-move]

…[and back 9d later][strava-vanmoof-move-back] (having added [pogies](#pogies) for no-nonsense hand-warming):

### *Fun* <a id="fun"></a>
TODO

### Health <a id="health"></a>

### Car sewers <a id="car-sewers"></a>
Biking in cities makes you realize that roads are terrible *places*. They're noisy, dirty, and dangerous because they are dominated by cars. They're awful to be in or around (unless you're in a car).

Interacting with roads on a bike *feels better* in its own right (in at least medium-dense areas, say): it's easy to see how many more people could do so and, if they did, how everyone would get where they're going more quickly/pleasantly/safely (including those who still need to use private cars for one reason or another).

It also underscores how ill-suited private cars are to urban environments: [watching one double-parked car or truck snarl blocks of traffic](#parking), hearing [horn honks or mufflers that are obnoxious (if not dangerous)](#noise) over [a radius that typically includes 1000's of homes](#honk-density), watching parents+stroller bullied in crosswalks by turning SUVs w/ [head-height grills](#grills), etc.… cars don't work very well in dense areas, and they ruin them for everyone outside them.

I'm sorry to speak so negatively but there is enormous, real, preventable harm happening every day because of the level of car-dependence in the US, and most Americans have never known any kind of modern or functional public transit, so it's important to talk both about how much better we can make things but also what is bad about the status quo that most people don't realize or fully appreciate. The [War on Cars](#war-on-cars) section discusses this with more detail and rigor.

## Getting Started <a id="getting-started"></a>
Everyone's journey will be different, but here are some resources and intermediate steps I've found useful on the way to relying on (e)cycling more:

### Bike Shares <a id="bike-shares"></a>
I [citibiked](https://www.citibikenyc.com/) in NYC and JC for years. I loved it and still love it. Electric-citibike inventory is hitting critical mass, and the system is expanding all the time. I will always keep an annual Citibike membership on auto-renew (it used to comparable to a 1mo MetroCard, now it's closer to 2; still a great value).

There's also a Cambrian explosion of scooter-shares, moped-shares, on-demand e-bike leasing services, etc. In my experience, most such things are worth signing up for and trying to use a few times, or for a few months, to see how they can fit in to your life.

I "graduated" to owning a bike somewhat accidentally; my local ferry shut down during COVID and I needed to get to a ferry stop in Hoboken (outside the Citibike JC area… [for now][jc-hoboken-citibike] 🙏). I'd also started to want to do longer rides, and felt a bit constrained generally by the limits of the Citibike network.

### Renting <a id="renting"></a>
When I reached a tipping point and started researching buying bikes, I rented a few bikes from my local [Grove Street Cycles](https://www.grovestreetbicycles.com/). One afternoon on [a modest "hybrid"](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/escape-2-disc) convinced me that, though I love Citibike, I'd outgrown it more than I realized, and a whole new class of mobility and freedom awaited from owning (vs. renting ≤45mins at a time) a nicer/lighter/faster bike.

I definitely recommend seeing if you can rent a few different kinds of bikes – including e-bikes! – as a way of learning about the options in a way that is more visceral than anything you can get reading reviews.

### Safety <a id="safety"></a>
This is a big topic and I am not an expert. [The League of American Cyclists has many resources and guides you should check out][LoAC-tips].

I have a few takes to offer as a recent novice, now intermediate city rider who's also been taking greener riders out.

#### Riding on sidewalks <a id="riding-on-sidewalks"></a>
- Where planners, drivers, and the auto industry have teamed up to make it impossible to bike safely, cyclists will ride on the sidewalk. The solution is to provide cyclists with a reasonable non-sidewalk option. Shame or enforcement are regressive and ineffective.
- Cyclists should make an extra effort to slow down and give a wide berth when mingling with pedestrians. The cyclist-pedestrian power dynamic is similar to the driver-cyclist or driver-pedestrian dynamics: your speed feels lower to you than to someone you are passing, especially who is not expecting you.

While cycling, the constant implicit violence (and occasional explicit violence) from drivers makes it hard to keep sight of that there are also tiers of more vulnerable road users beyond you. I think as cycling grows in popularity and we benefit from a virtuous adoption↔️infrastructure↔️awareness cycle, these dynamics will improve.

Unfortunately, the discourse around "bikes on sidewalks" is often poisoned by people advocating against anything that might promote cycling or make it safer or easier (which is ironic because sidewalk-riding is a [desire path][desire paths] that implies better cycling infrastructure is needed).

#### Stopping at stop signs + red lights <a id="stopping-at-stops"></a>
Cyclists should stop at stop signs and wait at red lights. Drivers shouldn't exceed the speed limit. Pedestrians shouldn't jaywalk.

The interesting question about these rules is how bad it is when they are broken.

##### Relative Harm
How bad is it when cyclists rolling through (or outright running) stop signs/lights? It's somewhere between [a pedestrian jaywalking] and [a car running a light] in severity. That is a wide range; specifics matter.
- A 200lb cyclist (+ 50lb bike) cruising through a stop sign at 8mph has the same kinetic energy as a 4000lb car inching through a stop at 2mph.
  - Speed matters in other ways though (esp. reaction time), so the former is probably worse than the latter in this example.
  - On the other hand, a cyclist failing to completely stop, but rolling through at 2mph, is definitely not as bad as a car doing the same thing (the car is a much deadlier vehicle with worse sight-lines).
- Several states have ["Idaho stops"][Idaho stop], which allow cyclists to treat stops as yields and lights as stops. I like this policy, not least because it emphasizes yielding to pedestrians in a way that gets lost when cyclists have been left to the wolves and started breaking rules made for cars.

##### Fear
I think cyclists run lights and signs when they are afraid.

When I was new to cycling in NYC, there was always a background hyper-vigilance and fear. I frequently see this in newer riders now. A bear is chasing you, some selfish survival instinct kicks in. It feels important to rush ahead, away from the cars waiting on the line with you at the light, or coming up from a light behind. Being around them – in front of them, in their headlights – is uncomfortable, you're very vulnerable. Your perspective can narrow so that the experience of a pedestrian you cut off feels very far away from your immediate visceral need to *go*.

I used to be more brazen about rolling through stops and lights, and I believe this *fear* and discomfort is a big reason why. I still feel the fear, but have learned to [vehicular-cycle][vehicular-cycling] more, and I'm not making decisions from as panicked a place. I still catch myself doing it though, and notice the fear driving it… maybe I just got close-passed, and I'm a little shaken, need to *go*. Or I'm getting bad vibes from a driver and need some distance.

Of course there's another argument for better cycling infrastructure here, it should not be so scary and dangerous. I think it's also good for cyclists to introspect about this dynamic, and how it may drive their choices.

### Route Planning <a id="route-planning"></a>

#### Street View <a id="street-view"></a>
Google Maps Street View has been indispensable for checking out roads before riding them.

Ironically, it can even help identify when Google Maps directions are sending you somewhere unsafe, like [this 4-lane, 50mph no-shoulder highway][ny22-streetview]:

[![Screenshot of Street View showing the 4-lane, 50mph approach to a bridge on NY-22, a 50mph speed limit, and an SUV parked in the last few feet of shoulder before a bridge railing goes right up to the edge of the lane](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110042517-e1bc5980-7d13-11eb-8580-d5a9bc5a3d81.png)][ny22-streetview]

[That is apparently a "bicycle-friendly road" (and prioritized by Google Maps' biking directions whenever I am planning routes in this area 😱)][ny22-gmaps]:
[![Screenshot of the same road on Google Maps, showing a dotted green line along it and a legend that indicates it is a ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110041735-9ce3f300-7d12-11eb-8c1c-71a31588721f.png)][ny22-gmaps]

I also used Street View extensively when making https://bit.ly/mellowbikewestchester ([discussion below](#mellow-bike-maps)); after a while you can get pretty fast at warping ahead by many increments, zooming in to scan for speed limit signs, and using the map detail in the lower-left to teleport longer distances, but it gets a bit tedious after a while. An interface better tailored to this use case would help.

I've also been surprised not to find any decent map apps that make it easy to see roads' speed-limits at a glance. I suspect the required data may exist in [OSM], but haven't had a chance to explore it much yet.

#### Ride with GPS <a id="ride-with-gps"></a>
I haven't used https://ridewithgps.com/ too much, but it seems to be a good place to look up and share routes that others have ridden.

For example, [here is someone's route up Manhattan's West Side Highway, looping between the George Washington and Tappan Zee bridges][rwgps-bridge-loop]:

[![Screenshot of a "Ride with GPS" route, showing a map view, elevation over distance, and summary statistics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110040762-4cb86100-7d11-11eb-8728-96871c71d024.png)][rwgps-bridge-loop]

#### "mellow bike maps" <a id="mellow-bike-maps"></a>
Inspired by [the Chicago "mellow bike map"][mellow-bike-chicago], I made a ["mellow bike Westchester" Google map][mellow-bike-westchester] while staying up there for a few weeks and trying to plan rides (for myself and others less experienced, where it was extra important not to accidentally end up on no-shoulder 45mph roads):

[![Screenshot of Google map of greater Westchester County, NY, with streets color-coded by bike-friendliness](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110040245-78871700-7d10-11eb-93fd-e64988be65c9.png)][mellow-bike-westchester]

## Starter Packs <a id="starter-packs"></a>

### VanMoof X3 ($2k; $3k w/ gear) <a id="vanmoof-x3-pack"></a>
The [VanMoof X3][X3] is the cheapest of my 3 ebikes, but is the best all-around / my go-to e-bike for trips around the city.

It starts at $2k, but I added:
- VanMoof's 3yr theft+maintenance plan ($590); 
- [front basket][vanmoof front basket] ($89), [back rack][vanmoof rear carrier] ($69)
- 2x[handlebar-mounted "feed bags"][revelate feedbag] ($49ea), 1x["Jerry can" tube-top bag][revelate jerrycan] ($46)
- [fleece-lined pogies] ($47) for toasty hands in below-freezing temps (I've only had it during winter months, so far)
- [bungee cable set] ($14) for securing items in the front basket

This $2k-$3k package should let you replace/improve a wide class of trips that you'd otherwise use other modes for. [See my more in-depth review below for more info](#x3-review).

### RadPower: <$2k? <a id="radpower"></a>
I actually have no experience with RadPower, but they are worth mentioning as a popular brand that [is aggressively going after a lower-pricepoint, mainstream audience][radpower-150mm].

## Reading <a id="reading"></a>

### [electricbikereview.com](https://electricbikereview.com/) <a id="ebr"></a>
This was consistently one of the highest-quality review sites I saw. I learned to seek them out on a Google results page, or go there directly to search for a specific bike.

They did the best job of showing critical stats about bikes in an easy-to-scan format, especially including stats that the industry is sheepish and user-hostile about (<i>\*ahem\* bike weight \*ahem\*</i>).

Here's are their reviews of [a Creo similar to mine][ebr-creo] and my [Tern Vektron Q9][ebr-q9]. Their brand pages are great too: [the Specialized reviews page][ebr-specialized] was very useful in sorting through a bunch of confusingly-named models.

### [r/ebikes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ebikes/) <a id="r-ebikes"></a>
Nice forum with encouraging/inspirational stories and examples

You might also find vendor-specific subreddits useful, like [r/vanmoof].

## Gear / Accessories <a id="gear"></a>
The right add-ons might cost 10-20% what your bike cost, but make it 10x more useful. Understanding the types of gear and accessories – let alone specific models – can be overwhelming.

Before I e-biked, I lived out of a backpack while in+around the city. Getting that weight off of me and onto the bike while in transit has been a huge improvement. The options for letting the bike roll things along with you – from "a purse" up to "several suitcases" – are worth exploring.

### Racks, Baskets <a id="racks-baskets"></a>
For carrying substantial weight or bulk, a back-wheel rack is the platform you build on. Front baskets/racks also range in size, and can significantly add to your carrying capacity.

- my VanMoof's [front][vanmoof front basket] and [rear racks][vanmoof rear carrier] let me roll [2 large panniers and a tote bag along with me](#pov-moving-house)
- my Tern has a super heavy duty ["Atlas" rack][tern atlas rack] that can hold 2 [panniers][tern bucketload panniers] as well as [a giant Market Basket][tern market basket]; I also put a smaller ["holdem basket"][tern holdem basket] on the front, for [maximum grocery capacity](#pov-grocery-runs).
- I got great use out of a [Topeak "Explorer" rack][topeak explorer rack] on my main non-electric bike (if not buying from the same brand that made your bike, you have to check a little more that things are compatible).

### Bags <a id="bags"></a>
There are a lot of incredible bags you can put on your bike. Panniers are the workhorses, but [Revelate] in particular offers dozens of bag shapes you can put basically anywhere else on your bike based on where they fit and how much capacity you want:

![Revelate image of a dirty touring bike with may bags attached all over](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110191019-79917480-7df4-11eb-9b2a-44f7b6a64135.png)
*this is the bike version of SUV commercials that show ridiculous off-roading the average SUV-owner will never do*

I bought 1 (or [6][revelate feedbag]) of nearly every bag they offer, and typically mix-and-match which bags make the most sense on which bikes for a given ride.

Getting weight off of you (esp. your back!) and onto the bike – where it just rolls – is an amazing part of getting around by bike (as opposed to walking or other transit modes where you may sometimes wind up standing).

#### Panniers <a id="panniers"></a>
Panniers are bags you can attach to a rack on the back of your bike, and are a great way to haul stuff by bike:

[![VanMoof X3 outside apartment building with 2 Ortlieb panniers on the back rack](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110146045-1974e100-7da8-11eb-9b80-911e44c17ffd.png)](#pov-moving-house)

[![Tern Vektron Q9 in elevator with two full panniers and front and rear baskets with grocery bags](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110146839-0a426300-7da9-11eb-917a-57c83443d23b.png)](#pov-grocery-runs)

I've tested a few kinds:
- [Ortlieb Back-Roller Classics] ($190/pair, 40L ea) are [a well-regarded set][wirecutter-ortlieb] that I've had the best experience with.
- I have [Tern-brand panniers][tern bucketload panniers] ($200/pair, 24L ea) for [my Tern](#q9-review), and they work well.
- I ordered [VanMoof panniers][vanmoof-small-panniers] (€78/pair, 18L ea) for [my VanMoof](#x3-review), but they haven't arrived yet, and the Ortliebs fit and work well (and are larger), so I'm not sure I'll need them.
- I also have a set of [Banjo Brothers Market Panniers] ($120/pair, 24L ea) that I've never really gotten in to using.
- Finally, I got [this backpack that converts to a pannier][backpack-pannier] ($180, 30L), and it's been very useful.

#### Cockpit Bags <a id="cockpit-bags"></a>
I love [Revelate's "Mountain Feedbags"][revelate feedbag]; I've put a pair on most of my bikes:

![Biking on 6th Ave with battery in feedbag charging phone mounted on handlebars](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110157461-31ebf800-7db6-11eb-85e2-cde1656df909.png)

Between them, I'll carry a battery that charges my phone while riding (and [sometimes other fun lights](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110158221-17fee500-7db7-11eb-96bf-cd8e55165742.png), [GoPro batteries](#gopro), etc.), a glasses case, tissues/chapstick/[hand-warmers](#hand-warmers)/snacks ("it's like a deli up here", someone who borrowed my bike said recently), airpods, extra masks, [resealable zip ties][zip ties 8"], etc. They are easily opened and closed with one hand, work on pretty much any bike, and are easy to transfer b/t bikes). Very useful.

#### Top-Tube Bags <a id="top-tube-bags"></a>
[The Revelate Mag-Tank 2000][revelate mag-tank 2000] (and earlier/smaller [Mag-Tank][revelate mag-tank]) are great bags that can sit on top of your top tube and hold lots of good stuff. Sometimes I'll have one up front and another at the base of my seat, and between them store wallet/keys, [cable lock][OTTO cable lock], full flat-change kit (tire levers, spare tube, CO₂ cartridge, multi-tool, patch-kit), etc. They're also easily openable/closeable with one hand, and the magnetic clasp is nice.

#### Back-Rack / Seat Bags <a id="back-bags"></a>
TODO

### Phone Mounts <a id="phone-mounts"></a>
Having my phone mounted up front on my handlebars has been surprisingly useful. I typically have Google Maps' turn-by-turn directions or [Strava's](#strava) speedometer up while riding:

[![chest-cam shot of phone mounted on handlebars displaying a Google Map, another e-biker is in front, and the George Washington Bridge is in the background](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110153857-948ec500-7db1-11eb-8fd9-3b13e3d68e5d.png)][strava-ebike-day]

When getting started, you're mostly riding in areas you're less familiar with. Having the map handy helps to not feel lost or get lost, as well as to e.g. find detours if a road doesn't feel safe.

I've exclusively used Quad Lock handlebar phone mounts ([the Wirecutter's choice][wirecutter-quadlock]) and associated phone cases. They are good products, though a bit pricier than I'd expect (e.g. $60 for ["out front" mount][quadlock-out-front-mount], $10 for [a black plastic "lever"][quadlock-lever] to replace the blue one that it comes with, $30 for [a compatible phone case][quadlock-pixel-5-case]). I still struggle to find the right angle to rotate the phone into the mount; I expect I'll get better at it over time. One-hand releasing is easy and convenient.

### Lights <a id="lights"></a>
You want a white "headlight" facing forward and a red taillight facing back. There are many options and they're mostly all good. Here are some I've used and like:
- [CYGOLITE Metro Plus][amzn cygolite metro plus] ($46): right head-light
- [CYGOLITE Hotrod][amzn cygolite hotrod] ($40): bright tail light
- [Vont 'Pyro' (set)][amzn vont pyro light] ($14): front+rear, good+cheap
- [KNOG (set)][amzn knog lights] ($): front+rear, very convenient; plug lights directly in to any USB-A port to charge, eacy to clip them to things. Good backups to keep in [a bag](#cockpit-bags)

I've also thrown [party][amzn party light] [lights][amzn party light 2] and [wheel lights][amzn wheel lights] on bikes.

### Misc. Accessories <a id="misc-accessories"></a>
- Bells: [this $6 Amazon bell][amzn bell] has worked well for me 3x. I also got [a Spurcycle][spurcycle-bell] ($49) after hearing that it is the best, but I think I prefer the Amazon one 🤷🏼‍♂️.
- Mirrors: [this handlebar-mounted rear-view mirror][amzn mirror] has served me well. I couldn't get [this one][amzn mirror 2] tight enough using its rubber spacers.
- Hand Pump: [this one][amzn pump] is super compact + light and contains a hose w/ presta and schrader nozzles
- Kickstand: [this two-legged style of kickstand][amzn kickstand] is sturdier and easier to deal with

### Gloves <a id="gloves"></a>
In warmer months, I wear ["MOREOK" gloves][amzn MOREOK gloves] ($17) on most rides. Some light gel-padding is nice on hands/wrists during longer rides.

In colder months, [Brooks LSD Thermal Gloves][Brooks gloves] ($50) are great touchscreen gloves with retractable, waterproof mitten covers. I can use my phone at like 90% with them, but they're also pretty warm with mitten covers pulled over. I've used them below freezing (mid/high 20ºF's) by putting [hand warmers](#hand-warmers) in the palm or mitten cover parts; wearing them inside [pogies](#pogies) is an even warmer+easier setup. They're very light and easily crumple/fold into small pocket spaces, so I keep them on me ≈6mos/yr.

See also [Winter Cycling Gear](#winter-cycling-gear) below for [heated glove](#heated-gloves) and [pogie](#pogies) recs.

### Rain gear <a id="rain-gear"></a>
I got some [Clever Hood "Rover" Capes] and they seem good, though I haven't used them a ton / haven't 100% integrated them into my routine yet. People I follow swear by them, and I basically get the vision of a well-designed + reliable "protection from wind+elements" system. They pack down well, so I bring them along as mix of a rain / optional-warmth layer sometimes.

### Winter Cycling Gear <a id="winter-cycling-gear"></a>
I grew up in Miami and have bad hands/feet circulation. I don't like the cold and I'm bad at it. Biking in cold weather (let alone cold rain/snow) generally sounds miserable to most people.

It turns out a a few $100 of gear and technology basically solves this problem. Whether you winter cycle or not, you should probably buy [heated gloves](#heated-gloves), [socks](#heated-socks), and [a vest](#heated-vests). My recs are below.

#### Aside: it's not *that* cold a lot of the time
I think people think it's colder in greater NYC more of the time [than it is](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/nyregion/climate-change-nyc.html). [January is the coldest month in NYC (avg daily hi/lo 39°/26°F)](https://share.getcloudapp.com/NQuKnNmj); for sure there are days and times when it is annoying to go out, but for the price of a couple car payments you can move that from "days under 50°F" (several months of the year) to "days under 30°F" (odd days here and there).

In the winter, cars often function as ["2 ton, internal combustion parkas"][ice-parkas]. Clearly they maximize internal comfort for riders, but they also [externalize a variety of costs][auto-externalities]. It turns out it's not *that* hard to keep warm in most situations while traveling more efficiently.

#### Heated Gloves <a id="heated-gloves"></a>
This winter I discovered heated gloves, and they are amazing (though also less necessary once I got [pogies](#pogies)):
- [VELAZZIO Thermo1 Battery Heated Gloves][velazzio gloves] ($90-10%):
  - These are my go-tos: charge via USB-C, sleek form factor, good warmth.
  - Below freezing (and without pogies), I wear them over my thin Brooks gloves, and put them on high.
  - Sizes run large (I got a "S" for my wife (5'4") but they ended up fitting me (6')), underside of button can borderline-overheat against bare hand on "high" setting
- [LUWATT Heated Gloves][luwatt gloves] ($50): good all-around, but became backups/loaners for me behind the Velazzio's above (a bit bulkier?)
- [Volt WOMENS 7V ALL PURPOSE HEATED GLOVES][volt gloves] ($150): after the "S" Velazzio's were huge, I found this higher-end brand that made me believe their palm measurements etc. were actually accurate. Size "S" does fit women 5'2"-5'4" I ride with. They generally seem sleek and good.

#### Heated Vests <a id="heated-vests"></a>
[This ARRIS Heated Vest][arris-vest-men] ($139 - $10 coupon; also [women's version][arris-vest-women]) is an excellent accesory, and dramatically changes what it's like to go out in the cold:
- 3 independent heat toggles for chest, stomach, and back+neck, and 5 heat levels on each.
- Comfortable, feels high-quality.
- Great zippered-pocket design.

Pushing buttons on the vest lets you control your core temperature across a ≈50ºF range without carrying bulky layers, and the 4 pockets are really useful. Highly recommended.

#### Heated Socks <a id="heated-socks"></a>
- [Binnice New Heated Socks Winter Electric Rechargeable 3 Heating Settings Thermal Sock Foot Warmer for Men and Women](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DKR47QP/) ($): just ordered these, but they were the top pick of an Amazon-commissioned "best heated socks" article.
- [Jomst 5000mAh Heated Socks for Men Women up to 8-25 Hours of Heating 3 Heating Settings Rechargeable Electric Heated Socks Winter Warm Socks for Skiing, Camping, Running, Fishing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GK7PVFJ/) ($38); these didn't seem to work. The battery turned on and seemed responsive to mode-toggling, but I never felt any heat, even on "high", after wearing them 5x.

#### Hand Warmers <a id="hand-warmers">
I have [a 40-pair box of disposable hand warmers][hand-warmers-box], and keep 3 pairs in a side pocket of my [handlebar bags](#cockpit-bags) when it's cold out (just in case). They're a good fail-safe if [heated gloves](#heated-gloves) or [socks](#heated-socks) aren't enough (or you didn't think you'd need them). Supposedly you can "recharge" them with boiling water, so as to avoid single-use waste, though I've not tried that.

### Padded Shorts <a id="padded-shorts"></a>
I often wear [BALEAF padded bike shorts][amzn BALEAF shorts] ($29); padded shorts seemed a little silly at first, but they're pretty good for biking but also misc other outdoor activities. I got some baggy swimsuit-style padded shorts and some spandex-y ones like this, and liked the latter better. The pockets on these are great as well. As it cooled down, I would wear them over tights.

### Post-Processing Videos <a id="post-processing"></a>
Videoing rides can generate huge amounts of data. My GoPro can shoot 4K @ 60FPS, but I learned the hard way to ratchet down to 1080p+24FPS. GoPro's cut shots into 4GB "chapters" (≈11mins at that resolution). My laptop's 1TB SSD could hold ≈45hrs of "low"-res video (if I had nothing else on it).

#### External SSDs <a id="ssds"></a>
I started with [a 1TB external SSD][amzn 1TB SSD] and added [a 2TB][amzn 2TB SSD] later. These things are pretty incredible, they fit in your palm:

#### Wasabi Cloud Storage <a id="wasabi"></a>
Eventually I filled up the 2TB too, and started putting data in [Wasabi][wasabi] (cheap cloud storage w/ good tooling). I'm stil in the free trial, but planning to use it as my canonical/archival store going forward, script moving new videos there automatically, and setting up downstream pipelines. My SSDs are not backed up anywhere so they might become an [LRU cache] of data in Wasabi. Given the price points, I'd rather pay-as-I-go on Wasabi than capacity-plan and deploy a RAID array on my desk 😁.

#### 512GB micro-SIM <a id="sim"></a>
In some sense the most absurd piece of technology I use is [this 512GB micro-SIM][amzn 512GB micro-SIM] that the GoPro records to:

![side-by-side of a 512GB micro-SIM card and a quarter (the latter about 3x the size)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110189779-55329980-7dee-11eb-9560-d058743ed859.png)
*where does all that data go…? 🤯*

I started with smaller SIMs, but worrying about the camera card's capacity was too annoying (on top of juggling battery + spares and archival storage capacity post-ride), and ultimately solvable for $75.

#### VFX suites <a id="vfx"></a>
I resisted using proper VFX suites to process my GoPro videos for a long time, but ultimately caved, bought [Final Cut Pro][fcp], and have been learning to use it. It does a good job abstracting over the 4GB GoPro "chapter" files that every shot is broken into, and is easy to use for speeding up / cutting video. The export flows are a bit clunky (videos as `.mov` only, frames as `.tiff`; I'm sure I'm missing things…) and I already want to script things on top of it, but it's a good start and very powerful beyond what I've learned.

https://goprotelemetryextractor.com/ seems good and able to deal with GoPro GPS/speed/etc. (which I've also not cracked in FCP).

I used to use GoPro's "Quik" app just for an auto-import when I plug my SIM in; I never found the VFX features usable. I've since given up on it altogether.
