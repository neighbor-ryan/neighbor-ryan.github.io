# E-bikes are a Transportation Revolution
I bought an e-bike in November, it was life-changing, and I quickly bought two more.

I've incepted friends and family with e-bike mania and am overwhelmed with e-bikes' potential to improve the lives of millions of people who don't realize it yet.

I'm documented my journey ‚Äì and reflections about the e-bike space ‚Äì here, in the hope it will help others.

## Bike-sharer ‚Üí bike-owner ‚Üí e-bike maniac <a id="progression"></a>
The COVID "bike boom" hit me hard:
- **2012 ‚Üí July 2020**:
  - Enthusiastic bike-share ([Citibike NYC][citibike]) user.
  - Frequently: take train to a place/event, bike home; 1-way option is nice!
  - The bikes are heavy and slow, but convenient.
- **July 2020**:
  - Got a hand-me-down roadbike.
  - "I still love Citibike, but this is much better for some trips/errands."
  - (As you will see, I have become a firm believer in "different bikes for different trips" üòÇ)
- **September**:
  - Need something for the grocery run.
  - Bought a "hybrid" (non-electric; [a cross between "road" and "mountain"; basically a "city bike"][hybrid]). Revelatory, love it.
  - Got lots of bags+accessories to fit different needs (errands+cargo, distance joy-ride, day around the city, etc.)
- **November 2020**:
  - I'd still like to try an e-bike.
  - Ideally it will haul even more cargo, and also fold up for easy storage (my office already has two drywall-mounted bikes and e-bikes are generally too heavy for that).
  - Bought a [Tern Vektron Q9][Q9] (folding + cargo bike).
- **December ‚Üí January 2021**:
  - E-bikes are revolutionary and I need more ü§©.
  - Helping friends+family try+buy.
  - Market moving so quickly; so many fascinating takes on what an "electric bike" is and can be.
  - Bought [an electric roadbike][Creo] and a [VanMoof X3][X3] (all-purpose city e-bike).

[![Home office with 2 bikes hanging on walls and one bike folded on ground](https://p199.p4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/OAuWd8eA/3f6c62d2-cd07-4df4-bb86-71d5164c4715.jpg?v=81611949ce3a4f2c6d934b673464e063)](https://share.getcloudapp.com/OAuWd8eA)
TODO: pic w/ all 5 bikes

### E-bike Inventory <a id="my-ebikes"></a>
My current e-bikes are:
1. [Tern Vekton Q9][Q9]: large cargo capacity, folds up for easy storage, one size fits all.
2. [VanMoof X3][X3]: great all-around / "city bike" / starter/lender for newcomers. One size fits all, automatic shifting, "turbo" button for quick starts.
3. [Specialized Creo][Creo]: electric road-bike; light and fast, long range.

Each is useful in different contexts, and together they cost less than half [the $40k average new car in the US](#cost) (see below for [starter packs in the $2k-$4k range](#starter-packs), or 1/20th to 1/10th the avg new car price).

I'll probably end up with 1 or 2 more. I want the ability to take people+cargo on rides that would otherwise require an SUV (and which would still be worse in various ways, and cost even more).

## Revelations <a id="revelations"></a>
E-biking has brought a string of revelations about my city, cities in general, mobility as a fundamental human need and right, [turbulent flows][cgp-grey-traffic], and more. Here are some things that have struck me in learning to get around by (e)bike:

### Speed (‚üπ Safety) <a id="speed-safety"></a>
It's counterintuitive, but having access to more speed (and acceleration) makes you dramatically safer on a bike. Starting from a stop at lights, holding a lane on shared roads, minimizing the number of cars that close on and overtake you (and the speed they overtake you at)‚Ä¶ you are much more in control of your relationship to traffic on an ebike. This is one of new e-bikers' biggest "üí°"/"ü§Ø" moments.

It's also surprising how a little boost makes a *big* difference in that feeling of control and safety. Moving top speed from 15mph to 20mph means a car going 25mph *passes you half as quickly* and *has twice as much time to "see you coming" as it comes up behind you*.

In more typical urban settings where cars might be averaging 15mph (between 0 and 20mph due to mild congestion and lights), it means you can find one driver who:
1. sees you
2. is not telegraphing their desire to murder you

and draft them for a while (until the next light, when you must bid them "üôè", glide up to the front, and find a new host).

You basically had to be a professional cyclist to access this ability to simply exist on car-dominated roads, but now almost everyone can.

### Speed (‚üπ Inclusion) <a id="speed-inclusion"></a>
The Speed‚üπSafety effect is particularly true for people who are not stereotypic young/fit men (women, children of all ages, older people, differently abled people, ‚Ä¶). I was brave enough ‚Äì [some of the time](#near-misses TODO) ‚Äì to bike around NYC before e-bikes, but it was not feasible for my wife (though she is in her 30's and reasonably athletic). This was due to the high baseline level of bullying from drivers (both inadvertent and intentional) as well as specific vitriol and threats she received as a woman taking space that some men motorists feel is theirs.

- TODO: other gender ridership: citibike
- TODO: historical bike feminism

### Speed (‚üπ Convenience) <a id="speed-convenience"></a>
The most obvious benefit of speed is that it lets you get from A to B faster (or for less work, at a given speed). Less worry about getting sweaty or feeling like getting home is daunting or you're not up for it. Generally easier to go places and do things.

[Class 1 e-bikes][ebike-classes] provide a pedal-assist up to 20mph; this lets casual riders (who normally top out at 12-15mph) play in the 15-20mph range and, as with [the "safety" angle](#safety-speed), that ‚âà30% difference actually makes for a qualitatively different experience. I consistently pass more cars than pass me now (except *sometimes* if I'm along the West Side Highway for long enough üòÇ). It's pretty hard to go 15-20mph in a car for very long in urban environments, so for a large class of trips.

This is a brand new, developing mode of transportation that changes the basic math of transportation in cities; my [Ride Hall of Fame][ride-hall-of-fame TODO] has some examples and discussion of this.

### Cost <a id="cost"></a>
On average, [a new car in the US costs $40k][new-car-cost]; [owning+operating a car costs $800/month][car-cost-800-mo].

Lots of the US effectively levies a $40k tax to participate in society, which hits the least well off the hardest.

[80% of car trips are under 5mi][TODO] and easily replaceable by a luxurious e-bike kit ‚Äì including gear and accessories to the max ‚Äì that costs 1/10th what a car costs.

#### 1 car ‚üπ 10 e-bikes + gear
When I am passing cars stuck in traffic, one of the saddest things is that each of those cars could have paid for 10 families' e-bike mobility solutions‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.

Some of the darkest images of the failed state of American governance as well as transportation culture were the long lines of cars at food banks during COVID lockdowns:

[![overhead shot of cars in line at a San Antonio food bank in April 2020, from Reuters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109445173-001d0f00-7a0d-11eb-9d7d-b8c58162dc22.png)
](https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/long-lines-at-food-banks-across-us-idUSRTX7EHU2)

[![overhead shot of cars in line at a San Diego food bank in April 2020, from ABC News](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109445290-44101400-7a0d-11eb-868c-38545f594874.png)](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/covid-19-crisis-heaps-pressure-nation-s-food-banks-n1178731)

We've struggled and failed to give people $2k of COVID relief, but have designed a society where they must spend $800/mo on the least efficient mode of transportation.

All together, including a huge variety of gear and accessories, they cost about $15k. That's , and I'm fortunate to be able to explore the top of the market. A person can get everything they need to replace car-dependence with price-conscious

### Space <a id="space"></a>
E-bikes take up very little space for the mobility they provide. Mode shift from private cars to e-bikes directly improves a large class of congestion and parking issues.

Taking up less space also means you can bring your bike with you on other modes when necessary (trains, buses, even ride-shares), store it easily, etc.

#### Bike vs. Car Storage <a id="bike-vs-car-storage"></a>
A critical area where American cities fail in enabling biking ‚Äì and especially e-biking ‚Äì is providing secure bike parking infrastructure.

[Oonee][oonee] (pronounced "uni") is an NYC-based startup I'm obsessed with that operates [phone-unlocked pods near transit where a dozen bikes can be stored][oonee-pod], and is piloting ["mini" pods that replace single-car parking spots w/ secure storage of 6-10 (e-)bikes][oonee-mini].

For comparison, here are some examples of bike parking in other countries that would be a nightmare if replaced with car-parking:

Compare to car-centric American analogs:

### Cargo <a id="cargo"></a>

There is a small (but growing), dedicated group of people that love to show off the things they haul on their (e-)bikes, that I recommend checking out (images link to tweets):
[![Tern GSD with a huge amount of groceries on the front and back](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109440506-854df700-7a00-11eb-8474-d96342f7828c.png)

#### Children <a id="children"></a>
Even my X3 (VanMoof's smallest bike) supports [a Yepp child seat][yepp-maxi] (the most popular brand I see used):

![VanMoof X3 with a child seat on the back](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109441255-c6dfa180-7a02-11eb-9b73-d177896842be.png)

Larger bikes can fit 2 on the back easily:

[![Woman biking in heels with two children facing each other and playing "patty cake" on the back of the bike](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109443060-99e1bd80-7a07-11eb-97b7-98d079e9c2e8.png)
](https://twitter.com/christineadair/status/1289669201674690560)

There are also front-loading options:

![Woman cargo-biking in NYC with 2 children in a bakfiet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109441210-9f88d480-7a02-11eb-90a3-90065b0b3b85.png)

[![Cargo bike carrying three children and their bikes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109442955-643cd480-7a07-11eb-8097-677d2e7491ad.jpeg)](https://twitter.com/genepedia/status/1272606386401079296)

Of course, it's possible to do even more with less:

![Woman biking with 4 children on a bicycle ‚Äì¬†2 in front, 2 in back](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109441501-61d87b80-7a03-11eb-96d8-46d06703c398.png)

but luckily, new and evolving e-bike technology is making all configurations much, much easier.

Finally, most children are capable of biking themselves to school at a relatively young age, if we kept them safe from drivers; see [re-thinking the school run][school-run] for more discussion.

#### PoV: Grocery Runs <a id="pov-grocery-runs"></a>
My grocery runs since getting an e-bike have also been so surprising and delightful that [I've been documenting them in an album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ASed6bguwTXAXSxt8):

![Groceries on counter-top: bread, soup, sauce, vegetables, cheeses](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109439533-aca2c500-79fc-11eb-926d-4f2cf9689af1.png)

#### PoV: Moving house <a id="pov-moving-house"></a>
Recently, I moved to my brother's empty apartment for 9d (after a small-chance of COVID exposure, to avoid any risk of exposing my wife).

I packed a comfortable >1wk vacation into 4 bags (2 [panniers][#panniers], 1 bag in front rack, 1 backpack), and [biked, ferried, and biked from Jersey City to the Flatiron][#vanmoof-move]:

### *Fun* <a id="fun"></a>
TODO

### Health <a id="health"></a>
TODO

### Car sewers <a id="car-sewers"></a>
Biking in cities makes you realize that roads are terrible *places*. They're noisy, dirty, and dangerous because they are dominated by cars. They're awful to be in or around (unless you're in a car).

Interacting with roads on a bike *feels better* in its own right (in at least medium-dense areas, say): it's easy to see how many more people could do so and, if they did, how everyone would get where they're going more quickly/pleasantly/safely (including those who still need to use private cars for one reason or another).

It also underscores how ill-suited private cars are to urban environments: [watching one double-parked car or truck snarl blocks of traffic](#parking), hearing [horn honks or mufflers that are obnoxious (if not dangerous)](#noise) over [a radius that typically includes 1000's of homes](#honk-density), watching parents+stroller bullied in crosswalks by turning SUVs w/ [head-height grills](#grills), etc.‚Ä¶¬†cars don't work very well in dense areas, and they ruin them for everyone outside them.

I'm sorry to speak so negatively but there is enormous, real, preventable harm happening every day because of the level of car-dependence in the US, and most Americans have never known any kind of modern or functional public transit, so it's important to talk both about how much better we can make things but also what is bad about the status quo that most people don't realize or fully appreciate. The [War on Cars](#war-on-cars) section discusses this with more detail and rigor.

## Getting Started <a id="getting-started"></a>
Everyone's journey will be different, but here are some resources and intermediate steps I've found useful on the way to relying on (e)cycling more:

### Bike Shares <a id="bike-shares"></a>
I [citibiked](https://www.citibikenyc.com/) in NYC and JC for years. I loved it and still love it. Electric-citibike inventory is hitting critical mass, and the system is expanding all the time. I will always keep an annual Citibike membership on auto-renew (it used to comparable to a 1mo MetroCard, now it's closer to 2; still a great value).

There's also a Cambrian explosion of scooter-shares, moped-shares, on-demand e-bike leasing services, etc. In my experience, most such things are worth signing up for and trying to use a few times, or for a few months, to see how they can fit in to your life.

I "graduated" to owning a bike somewhat accidentally; my local ferry shut down during COVID and I needed to get to a ferry stop in Hoboken (outside the Citibike JC area‚Ä¶ [for now][jc-hoboken-citibike] üôè). I'd also started to want to do longer rides, and felt a bit constrained generally by the limits of the Citibike network.

### Renting <a id="renting"></a>
When I reached a tipping point and started researching buying bikes, I rented a few bikes from my local [Grove Street Cycles](https://www.grovestreetbicycles.com/). One afternoon on [a modest "hybrid"](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/escape-2-disc) convinced me that, though I love Citibike, I'd outgrown it more than I realized, and a whole new class of mobility and freedom awaited from owning (vs. renting ‚â§45mins at a time) a nicer/lighter/faster bike.

I definitely recommend seeing if you can rent a few different kinds of bikes ‚Äì including e-bikes! ‚Äì as a way of learning about the options in a way that is more visceral than anything you can get reading reviews.

### Safety <a id="safety"></a>
This is a big topic and I am not an expert. [The League of American Cyclists has many resources and guides you should check out][LoAC-tips].

I have a few takes to offer as a recent novice, now intermediate city rider who's also been taking greener riders out.

#### Riding on sidewalks <a id="riding-on-sidewalks"></a>
- Where planners, drivers, and the auto industry have teamed up to make it impossible to bike safely, cyclists will ride on the sidewalk. The solution is to provide cyclists with a reasonable non-sidewalk option. Shame or enforcement are regressive and ineffective.
- Cyclists should make an extra effort to slow down and give a wide berth when mingling with pedestrians. The cyclist-pedestrian power dynamic is similar to the driver-cyclist or driver-pedestrian dynamics: your speed feels lower to you than to someone you are passing, especially who is not expecting you.

While cycling, the constant implicit violence (and occasional explicit violence) from drivers makes it hard to keep sight of that there are also tiers of more vulnerable road users beyond you. I think as cycling grows in popularity and we benefit from a virtuous adoption‚ÜîÔ∏èinfrastructure‚ÜîÔ∏èawareness cycle, these dynamics will improve.

Unfortunately, the discourse around "bikes on sidewalks" is often poisoned by people advocating against anything that might promote cycling or make it safer or easier (which is ironic because sidewalk-riding is a [desire path][desire paths] that implies better cycling infrastructure is needed).

#### Stopping at stop signs + red lights <a id="stopping-at-stops"></a>
Cyclists should stop at stop signs and wait at red lights. Drivers shouldn't exceed the speed limit. Pedestrians shouldn't jaywalk.

The interesting question about these rules is how bad it is when they are broken.

##### Relative Harm
How bad is it when cyclists rolling through (or outright running) stop signs/lights? It's somewhere between [a pedestrian jaywalking] and [a car running a light] in severity. That is a wide range; specifics matter.
- A 200lb cyclist (+ 50lb bike) cruising through a stop sign at 8mph has the same kinetic energy as a 4000lb car inching through a stop at 2mph.
  - Speed matters in other ways though (esp. reaction time), so the former is probably worse than the latter in this example.
  - On the other hand, a cyclist failing to completely stop, but rolling through at 2mph, is definitely not as bad as a car doing the same thing (the car is a much deadlier vehicle with worse sight-lines).
- Several states have ["Idaho stops"][Idaho stop], which allow cyclists to treat stops as yields and lights as stops. I like this policy, not least because it emphasizes yielding to pedestrians in a way that gets lost when cyclists have been left to the wolves and started breaking rules made for cars.

##### Fear
I think cyclists run lights and signs when they are afraid.

When I was new to cycling in NYC, there was always a background hyper-vigilance and fear. I frequently see this in newer riders now. A bear is chasing you, some selfish survival instinct kicks in. It feels important to rush ahead, away from the cars waiting on the line with you at the light, or coming up from a light behind. Being around them ‚Äì in front of them, in their headlights ‚Äì is uncomfortable, you're very vulnerable. Your perspective can narrow so that the experience of a pedestrian you cut off feels very far away from your immediate visceral need to *go*.

I used to be more brazen about rolling through stops and lights, and I believe this *fear* and discomfort is a big reason why. I still feel the fear, but have learned to [vehicular-cycle][vehicular-cycling] more, and I'm not making decisions from as panicked a place. I still catch myself doing it though, and notice the fear driving it‚Ä¶ maybe I just got close-passed, and I'm a little shaken, need to *go*. Or I'm getting bad vibes from a driver and need some distance.

Of course there's another argument for better cycling infrastructure here, it should not be so scary and dangerous. I think it's also good for cyclists to introspect about this dynamic, and how it may drive their choices.

#### Hi-viz

### Route Planning <a id="route-planning"></a>

#### Street View <a id="street-view"></a>
Google Maps Street View has been indispensable for checking out roads before riding them.

Ironically, it can even help identify when Google Maps directions are sending you somewhere unsafe, like [this 4-lane, 50mph no-shoulder highway][ny22-streetview]:

[![Screenshot of Street View showing the 4-lane, 50mph approach to a bridge on NY-22, a 50mph speed limit, and an SUV parked in the last few feet of shoulder before a bridge railing goes right up to the edge of the lane](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110042517-e1bc5980-7d13-11eb-8580-d5a9bc5a3d81.png)][ny22-streetview]

[That is apparently a "bicycle-friendly road" (and prioritized by Google Maps' biking directions whenever I am planning routes in this area üò±)][ny22-gmaps]:
[![Screenshot of the same road on Google Maps, showing a dotted green line along it and a legend that indicates it is a ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110041735-9ce3f300-7d12-11eb-8c1c-71a31588721f.png)][ny22-gmaps]

I also used Street View extensively when making https://bit.ly/mellowbikewestchester ([discussion below](#mellow-bike-maps)); after a while you can get pretty fast at warping ahead by many increments, zooming in to scan for speed limit signs, and using the map detail in the lower-left to teleport longer distances, but it gets a bit tedious after a while. An interface better tailored to this use case would help.

I've also been surprised not to find any decent map apps that make it easy to see roads' speed-limits at a glance. I suspect the required data may exist in [OSM], but haven't had a chance to explore it much yet.

#### Ride with GPS <a id="ride-with-gps"></a>
I haven't used https://ridewithgps.com/ too much, but it seems to be a good place to look up and share routes that others have ridden.

For example, [here is someone's route up Manhattan's West Side Highway, looping between the George Washington and Tappan Zee bridges][rwgps-bridge-loop]:

[![Screenshot of a "Ride with GPS" route, showing a map view, elevation over distance, and summary statistics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110040762-4cb86100-7d11-11eb-8728-96871c71d024.png)][rwgps-bridge-loop]

#### "mellow bike maps" <a id="mellow-bike-maps"></a>
Inspired by [the Chicago "mellow bike map"][mellow-bike-chicago], I made a ["mellow bike Westchester" Google map][mellow-bike-westchester while staying up there for a few weeks and trying to plan rides (for myself and others less experienced, where it was extra important not to accidentally end up on no-shoulder 45mph roads):

This was consistently one of the highest-quality review sites I saw. I learned to seek them out on a Google results page, or go there directly to search for a specific bike.

They did the best job of showing critical stats about bikes in an easy-to-scan format, especially including stats that the industry is sheepish and user-hostile about (<i>\*ahem\* bike weight \*ahem\*</i>).

Here's are their reviews of [a Creo similar to mine][ebr-creo] and my [Tern Vektron Q9][ebr-q9]. Their brand pages are great too: [the Specialized reviews page][ebr-specialized] was very useful in sorting through a bunch of confusingly-named models.

### Gloves
- [MOREOK Mens Cycling Gloves,Half Finger Biking Glove MTB DH Road Bicycle Gloves Gel Pad Shock-Absorbing Anti-Slip Breathable Motorcycle Mountain Bike Gloves Unisex Women](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B3PX6TC/) ($17); padded, fingerless gloves for non-winter months.
- [Brooks LSD Thermal Glove](https://www.jackrabbit.com/brooks-lsd-thermal-glove---color%3A-black-size%3A-s/609465426438.html) ($50); good touchscreen gloves with retractable, waterproof mitten cover.

### Padded shorts
[BALEAF Men's Bike Cycling Underwear Shorts 3D Padded Bicycle MTB Liner Mountain Shorts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WSBTQH7/) ($29)

This seemed like ridiculous "serious-biker drag" at first, but quickly crossed over to "reasonable/preferred shorts for biking but also other running around / [aerobie](#TODO)." I got some baggy swimsuit-style padded shorts and some spandex-y ones like this, and the latter are just much better. The pockets on these are great as well. As it cooled down, I would wear them over [tights](#TODO).

## Heated Gear <a id="heated-gear"></a>
I grew up in Miami and have bad hands/feet circulation; I don't like the cold and I'm bad at it. Biking in cold air (let alone cold rain/snow) generally sounds miserable to most people.

It turns out a a few $100 of new gear and technology basically solves this problem. Whether you winter cycle or not, you should probably buy heated gloves, socks, and a vest. My recs are below, and [more discussion of why winter cycling is actually great is here](#winter-cycling).

### Heated Gloves <a id="heated-gloves"></a>
- [VELAZZIO [Upgrade] Thermo1 Battery Heated Gloves - 3 Heating Levels w/Intelligent Control, up to 8hrs Warmth, 3M Thinsulate Waterproof Breathable Winter Gloves, Touchscreen Ski Gloves Men & Women](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YBW4LCL/) ($90-10%): these are my go-tos.
  - **Good**:
    - batteries charge via USB-C (no rotating the plug 180!)
    - generally sleek form factor, good warmth
  - **Bad**:
    - on the high setting I've noticed an overheated spot under the mode-toggle button on top of the back of my hands. Battery-overheating risk is one of the diciest-seeming things about betting on wearing tons of Li-ion cells everywhere, so this is concerning, but it's not *that* bad, so they're still my favorite.
    - I got size S, hoping they'd fit Cora, but they fit me about as comfortably as the size-L LUWATT's below (and are way too big for Cora and her sister ‚Äì 5'2"-5'4").
- [LUWATT Heated Gloves 8H Working Hours Rechargeable Lithium Battery Three Temperature Settings Electric Heat Resistant Gloves for Men Women for Sports Outdoor Climbing Hiking Skiing Winter Handwarmer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YYNJ4JQ/) ($50): these are good, but became backups/loaners for me behind the Velazzio's above, mostly because they feel a bit bulkier, I think? Since I've noticed the Velazzio's overheat, I may try these again. Amazon only offers L and XL.
- [WOMENS 7V ALL PURPOSE HEATED GLOVES](https://voltheat.com/collections/heated-gloves/products/all-purpose-womens-7v-heated-gloves) ($150): after the "S" Velazzio's were huge, I found this higher-end brand that made me believe their palm measurements etc. were actually accurate. Size S does fit Cora+Leah üéâ and they generally seem sleek and good.

### Heated Socks <a id="heated-socks"></a>
- [Binnice New Heated Socks Winter Electric Rechargeable 3 Heating Settings Thermal Sock Foot Warmer for Men and Women](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DKR47QP/) ($): just ordered these, but they were the top pick of an Amazon-commissioned "best heated socks" article.
- [Jomst 5000mAh Heated Socks for Men Women up to 8-25 Hours of Heating 3 Heating Settings Rechargeable Electric Heated Socks Winter Warm Socks for Skiing, Camping, Running, Fishing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GK7PVFJ/) ($38); these didn't seem to work. The battery turned on and seemed responsive to mode-toggling, but I never felt any heat, even on "high", after wearing them 5x.

### Heated Vests <a id="heated-vests"></a>
- [ARRIS Heated Vest for Men, 7.4V Electric Size Adjustable Heating Vest for Hunting, Camping, Fish Suitable for Men and Women](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NW4LK62/) ($139 - $10 coupon): excellent accesory. 3 independent heat toggles for chest, stomach, and back+neck, and 5 heat levels on each. Comfortable and feels high-quality. Qualitatively changes what it's like to go out in the cold.
- [ARRIS Heated Vest for Women, Size Adjustable 7.4V Electric Warm Vest 8 Heating Panels with Battery Pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VKLKSYV/) ($139 - $10 coupon): same thing, smaller/women's size (‚âà5'4" vs. 6').

## Proselytization

### Winter Cycling <a id="winter-cycling"></a>

#### It's not *that* cold a lot of the time
I think people think it's colder in greater NYC more of the time [than it is](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/nyregion/climate-change-nyc.html). [January is the coldest month in NYC (avg daily hi/lo 39¬∞/26¬∞F)](https://share.getcloudapp.com/NQuKnNmj); for sure there are days and times when it is annoying to go out, but for the price of a couple car payments you can move that from "days under 50¬∞F" (several months of the year) to "days under 30¬∞F" (odd days here and there).

Someone described cars in winter as "4000lb internal-combustion parkas." Obviously cars are a pinnacle of comfort, but they cause [a huge amount of harm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externalities_of_automobiles), and it's not *that* hard to keep warm other more ways while generally being more efficient.

### War on Cars <a id="war-on-cars"></a>

#### Parking
(multiple economic sectors now involve near-constant double-parking, because for some reason we decided that >50% of every street should be free car storage), 

#### Noise

horns are loud
