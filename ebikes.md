# E-bikes are a Transportation Revolution
I bought an e-bike in November, it was life-changing, and now I have 4 (all pedal-assist, not throttle).

I've incepted friends and family with e-bike mania and am overwhelmed with e-bikes' potential to improve the lives of millions of people who don't realize it yet.

I'm documenting my journey and reflections about the e-bike space in the hope it will help others.

[![4 e-bikes on the Hoboken waterfront](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109428064-3fbf0900-79c3-11eb-97c5-cd2662676563.png)][strava-ebike-day]

## Background: Bike-sharer → Bike-owner → E-bike maniac <a id="background"></a>
The COVID "bike boom" hit me hard:
- **2012 → July 2020**:
  - Enthusiastic bike-share ([Citibike NYC][citibike]) user.
  - Frequently: take train to a place/event, bike home; 1-way option is nice!
  - The bikes are heavy and slow, but convenient.
- **July 2020**:
  - Got a hand-me-down roadbike.
  - "I still love Citibike, but this is better for some trips/errands."
- **September 2020**:
  - Want something for grocery runs.
  - Bought a "hybrid" (non-electric; [a cross between "road" and "mountain" bikes; basically a "city bike"][hybrid]). Revelatory, love it.
  - Got [lots of bags+accessories](#gear) to fit different needs (errands/cargo, distance/joy-ride, day in the city, etc.)
- **November 2020**:
  - Still want to try an e-bike.
  - Ideally a hauler, that could also fold up for easy storage (my office already had two wall-mounted bikes, but e-bikes are generally too heavy for that).
  - Bought a [Tern Vektron Q9][Q9] (folding + cargo bike).
- **December → January 2021**:
  - E-bikes are revolutionary and I need more 🤩.
  - Helping friends+family try+buy.
  - Market moving quickly; many fascinating takes on what an "electric bike" can be.
  - Bought [an electric roadbike][Creo] and a [VanMoof X3][X3] (all-purpose city e-bike).
- **June 2021**:
  - Got a [Brompton Electric](#e-brompton); small fold + portable, nice for little errands, bringing it inside buildings/restaurants
  - 3k total miles, mix of errands, recreation, and longer/overnight trips

![4 ebikes in my office: electric roadbike (Creo) on the wall, Brompton and Tern folded in a corner, and VanMoof X3 next to them](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125326778-69dcec00-e310-11eb-9507-beb37eb8b4dd.png)

## E-bike Inventory <a id="my-ebikes"></a>
My current e-bikes are:
1. [VanMoof X3](#x3): great all-around/starter city bike. One size fits all, automatic shifting, "turbo" button for quick starts. $83/mo includes theft replacement, insurance, maintenance.
2. [Brompton Electric](#e-brompton): most compact fold, easy to bring into buildings/stores, great all-around city bike, one size fits all.
3. [Tern Vekton Q9](#q9): folding cargo bike, one size fits all.
4. [Specialized Creo](#creo): electric road-bike; light and fast, long range.

Each is useful in different contexts, and together they cost less than half [the $40k average new car in the US](#cost) (see below for [starter packs from $2k or $83/mo](#starter-packs), 1/20th to 1/10th the avg new car price).

I'll probably [end up with 1 or 2 more](#other-ebikes). In particular, I want the ability to take people+cargo on rides that would otherwise require an SUV (which might still be worse in various ways, and would definitely cost much more), so [I'm eyeing a RadWagon](#radwagon).

### [VanMoof X3][X3] <a id="x3"></a>
- Excellent all-around / starter e-bike
- [$83/mo includes theft replacement, insurance, maintenance][VanMoof financing].
- You may want to be within range of a VanMoof shop (I recommend [booking a test ride][VanMoof test ride] if you are!)

![VanMoof + gear parked in Sheep's Meadow in Central Park, NYC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125368539-682f1a80-e348-11eb-8fe4-52089212e8bc.png)

#### Automatic Shifting <a id="x3-shifting"></a>
VanMoofs automatically shift gears for you, based on your speed, which makes for a simpler/carefree riding experience. I first tried it in a very hilly place, and it took some getting used to, but now I love it for casual city riding.

Some advice about it:
- Use the "turbo" button liberally on uphills, and when starting from a stop.
- The gears shift based on your speed (not cadence, or torque).
  - In the beginning I got frustrated not knowing why it wasn't shifting, or when it would, as I spun the pedals or slowed down while starting a climb.
  - I spent some time in the app micro-managing the speeds at which it would shift into each gear. After a bunch of thrashing, I think I ended up back at almost exactly the factory defaults 😂 (having also learned the glory of the turbo button).

#### Internal Locking <a id="x3-internal-locking"></a>
VanMoofs have a lock inside the bike. You engage it by pushing a button on the frame, and disengage it from the app on your phone.

It doesn't stop someone from picking the bike up and throwing it in the back of a truck, but the bike does make an alarm sound if moved while locked, and VanMoofs have a few other forms of DRM (including a tracking chip and ["bike hunters" team][VanMoof bike hunters]) that hopefully make them less attractive to thieves.

#### Reliability / Shop Proximity <a id="x3-reliability"></a>
A common refrain on [r/vanmoof] is that you should be prepared to take it to the shop for tune-ups or troubleshooting.

I've had to go in once because we transferred ownership of the bike between VanMoof accounts, and it ended up stuck in "EU mode" with a top speed of 20kph (instead of the US's 20mph). It was easy enough to fix in the shop, and I definitely endorse buying the theft+maintenance plan for peace of mind.

#### Shipping <a id="x3-shipping"></a>
I've observed them to quote a 2-3mo timeframe for shipping, only to have the bike show up in a couple weeks!

#### "Boost button" <a id="boost-button"></a>
When you press or hold this button on the handlebar, the pedal assist is amplified for a few seconds. It's great for accelerating from a stop, or holding a line in traffic.

It's one of my favorite features on all my ebikes; I've noticed I am an extra curteous rider on my VanMoof because stopping and starting again is no sweat, thanks to the boost button.

#### Range <a id="vanmoof-range"></a>
- I get ≈30mi to a charge, using the "boost button" liberally.
- I'll receive [a "PowerBank" extra battery][VanMoof PowerBank] in the next few weeks which I expect will increase my range to ≈50-60mi.
- A full recharge takes a few hours.

I stayed in a friend's apt for 2wks via VanMoof:

It worked well through the winter:

I also occasionally do [grocery runs](#pov-grocery-runs) with it:
![VanMoof with 2 cases of Wild Basin bungeed into the front rack, panniers on the back](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125368650-b93f0e80-e348-11eb-8f72-e6250f2fa63d.png)

### Brompton Electric <a id="e-brompton"></a>
I got this one most recently from [Redbeard] in Brooklyn. Bromptons are a classic/famous British folding bike, and they did a decent job engineering a motor and battery onto the front.

![Brompton Electric, with lights around the frame, at ferry terminal as boat comes in](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125362410-db329400-e33c-11eb-88b6-2f70175dc69b.png)

#### Pros
- Most compact fold of all bikes (electric or not!); relatively portable ([fits in an airplane overhead bin!](https://www.google.com/search?q=brompton+overhead+bin&tbm=isch)).
- [Half-folded "shopping cart" mode can be pushed around in stores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m91tfT4AMLY).
- Surprisingly nice ride / feels like a normal bike (despite looking a bit flimsy/silly due to small 16" wheels).
- Decent extra battery story for increased range; currently my 2nd highest range ebike (after the [Creo](#creo)) as a result.
- Great mix of fun/whimsy with real transportation / portability / overall utility.

#### Cons
- Expensive ($3800) for relatively small amount of bicycle/machine. They're well-made, so I felt it was worth it (once I'd covered other ebike use cases), but the price point is simply too high to be relevant to most people I talk to.
- Supply chain has been especially backed up since COVID.
- Still a bit heavy to lug around (32lbs just the bike, 38 w/ battery, 40 with a rack).

### Tern Vektron Q9 <a id="q9"></a>
This was my first ebike, from [Bfold], a delightful bike store in the East Village (David was really helpful at talking me through the market when I was starting from zero).

I also test rode a Vektron at [Propel][Propel BK] in Brooklyn, who had a very slick appointment-booking flow and beautiful inventory of Reise & Muller bikes. [Their YouTube channel][Propel YouTube] is also an excellent source of ebike info; [here's their review of the Vektron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhOQxky0lo).

![Tern Vektron Q9 loaded up with plants at a plant store](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125362097-4e87d600-e33c-11eb-977f-3db950ebee0a.png)

#### Pros
- High-quality + rugged; Bosch motor system is premium.
- Folding, cargo, and electric are hard to find in one bike
  - The Vektron is the only model I know that does a good job at all 3.
  - See ["Grocery Runs" section](#pov-grocery-runs)
- Nice folded+rolling mode ([demo video](https://youtu.be/mi_3ZMbkufU?t=2057))
- One size fits most (4'9"–6'5"); good [telescoping seat post](https://youtu.be/mi_3ZMbkufU?t=515), [adjustable handlebar/stem system](https://youtu.be/mi_3ZMbkufU?t=605)

#### Cons
- Expensive ($3200): it's obviously a heavy-duty machine, so it's clearer what you are paying for, but that's still sticker-shock-inducing for most people
- Heavy (49lbs): again, this is understandable given its sturdy build and cargo-hauling emphasis, but you don't want to carry it up stairs
- Still large when folded: it folds in half (as opposed to the Brompton's thirds), folded footprint is more "corner of room" than "under desk".
- A minor annoyance is that the battery recharge socket is blocked by the frame, so you basically have to take the battery off of the frame to charge it. It's pretty easy to do though and not a big deal, to me.

### [Specialized Turbo Creo SL Comp Carbon ("Creo")][Specialized Turbo Creo SL Comp Carbon] <a id="creo"></a>
The Creo is a high-end, carbon-frame road-bike with a slick integrated motor+battery. Specialized seems to be one of the first brands to have executed on this really well, and the result is a transportation machine the likes of which has never existed before. It's really incredible: light, fast, fun to ride, smooth pedal assist, very efficient / long range.

![Creo plugged in + charging, along with "range extender" extra battery](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125377936-d7fad080-e35b-11eb-8bc4-0784a04bfeef.png)

The "never existed before" claim can be applied to many ebikes, since there are many companies exploring a huge design space, and leveraging cutting-edge battery and bike material technologies, but the Creo is remarkable for having many of the best attributes of ebikes as well as of performance road-bikes. It starts at 28lbs (including battery+motor), has the most range (40-130mi, depending on boost level and extra battery use), and provides a mobility superpower that very few people have experienced.

#### Specialzed "Turbo" E-Bikes <a id="specialized-turbo"></a>
Specialized is one of the most famous bike brands, and "Turbo" is their ebike line. Their branding and marketing pages confused me at first, but I eventually decoded the marketing-speak:

There are 4 types of Specialized "Turbo" ebikes:
- [Creo]: road bike
- [Levo]: mountain bike
- [Vado]: hybrid (b/t road and mountain) bike
- [Como]: city bike / cruiser

Within each line, a few variants may appear:
- SL ("Super-Light"): lighter weight version (including a less powerful motor and smaller battery), cf. [Creo SL], [Levo SL], [Vado SL], [Como SL].
- EQ ("EQuipped"): comes with fenders and a rack
- Carbon: most Creo and Levo models have carbon frames, but their entry levels are a slightly heavier aluminum alloy
- Expert: slightly nicer and lighter than the entry-level carbon frames (e.g. carbon wheels, better shifter)
- EVO: [something about the geometry being a little more off-road friendly](https://youtu.be/FikFAkl1iDU?t=6)
- S-Works: this is Specialized most prestigious brand (ebike or otherwise); generally 2x the price for benefits that seem marginal to me (but I've never ridden one, and I'm a casual enough cyclist that I'd rather have 2 Creos so a friend could ride one with me than one S-Works 😄)

Finally, the links above go to marketing sites for each ebike line, but from there you can click through to the actual shop pages, and some decent model-comparison pages.

#### Motor / Battery / Range
**tl;dr:**
- 40mi (60mi w/ extra battery that fits in water bottle holder, plugs into bike during ride) on boost 2 (of 3)
- 90mi (135mi w/ extra battery) on boost 1 of 3
- smaller battery and less powerful motor are nontheless very efficient
- road-bike setup means it's easy and efficient to provide power yourself; bike just gives you a nice boost

At first blush some Specialized ebike specs seemed underwhelming. For example, the Creo has a 320Wh battery and 240W motor (the lowest of all my ebikes).

However, some combination of factors results in my Creo getting by far the most range of all my ebikes:
- lower power levels generally seem to correspond to more total range; a twice-as-high boost level will exhaust a battery more than twice as quickly
- lower power output from the bike means it is effectively tricking you into supplying more power, over a given distance
- building on the above, the road-bike posture means it is easy and comfortable to actually work on the Creo; my other ebikes are more upright, and it's hard to help the bike much even if you want to (or get a real workout)
- the carbon frame (and smaller battery+motor) make the Creo 10-25lbs lighter than my other ebikes, so a given Wh battery goes further

I usually ride on boost level 2 (of 3), and get 40mi (or 60 with the [range extender], which is the slickest extra-battery story on any of my ebikes). The motor is super smooth, it feels like you are riding a really nice roadbike but with an incredible tailwind giving you an extra 3-5mph. It also provides assist up to 28mph (whereas my other bikes top out at 20mph).

For longer rides, or rides with leg-bikers, I can drop to boost level 1, where it's effectively just compensating for the extra weight of the motor+battery (maybe a bit more), and I get 90mi (or 135 with the range extender, presumably; I haven't tested that yet!).

#### Pros <a id="creo-pros"></a>
- It's a dream to ride: fast, fun, efficient, long range, and feels like a really nice road-bike.
- You can work as much as you want on it; there are even professional cyclists starting to use it for training.
- Lightweight for an ebike (28lbs):
  - More like 35lbs with the baggage I always keep on it (tubes/pump in handlebar roll bag, misc junk in handlebar "snack bags").
  - Not exactly "throw over your shoulder" light, but a big difference from other ebikes that are 2x that weight or more (electric citibikes are 75lbs!).
- Smaller frame battery combined with "range extender" extra battery means it's easy to shed a few lbs of battery weight if you know you won't need it (as opposed to other ebikes that have a large/heavier battery as the default option)

#### Cons <a id="creo-cons"></a>
- Cost ($7k): obviously this is way out of bounds for most people. I was one of those people, but once I found myself a couple ebikes in, having done a lot of research + demos, gotten very excited about the space (and exploring where the limits were and what was possible), and made peace with a significant ebike budget (embracing ebikes as a substitute for a car), I was drawn to it.
- No integrated lights, difficult to add bags / carrying capacity, difficult/uncommon to add fenders: it is meant to be an elite racing bike, and added accessories/weight is pooh-pooh'd by bike shops and experts. Nevertheless, I wanted a lightweight+fast ebike for transportation, so [I have made some "bikepacking" configurations work](#creo-bikepacking).

My longest ride to date was a 93mi day on [the "Harbor Ring" ride][Harbor Ring] (around New York harbor, except for the 2mi Verrazzano bridge between Brooklyn and Staten Island, which has 13 lanes for cars and biking/walking is prohibited):

![Strava map showing a 92.8mi ride between each end of the Verrazzano bridge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125375455-0e821c80-e357-11eb-9589-2d0cfd80f3c7.png)

I was leading a group of leg-bikes, and alternated between boost levels 1, 2, and 0 (just riding it as a regular road-bike with some extra weight, which was also totally fine; I was generally still slowing down to wait for folks).

## Other Notable E-bikes <a id="other-ebikes"></a>
Some other models I've looked at or helped people buy:

### [Specialized Turbo Vado SL ("Vado")][Vado SL] <a id="vado"></a>
This is the "hybrid" (straight handlebars, but fast like a roadbike) version of [my "Creo" electric roadbike](#creo) (part of [the Specialized "Turbo" ebike line discussed above](#specialized-turbo)). It has the same motor/battery system that I love from the Creo, and is also just an incredible machine. It has essentially all the speed/range/quality of the Creo, but you can put a rack and panniers on it and haul stuff / use it around a city a bit more easily.

My sister-in-law has a [Vado 4.0 SL EQ], and my mother-in-law has [a "step-through" version][Vado 4.0 SL EQ Step-through]. I've been thinking about getting a [Vado 5.0 SL EQ] (newer model, has a couple nice features over the 4.0 (like [the "Future Shock" handlebar suspension][Specialized Future Shock]).

### [RadWagon] <a id="radwagon"></a>
This is a true cargo e-bike (as opposed to [my Vektron Q9](#q9), which has less capacity and power, as a foldability tradeoff) for just $1900. [RadPower is aggressively targeting a mainstream price point][radpower-150mm], seemingly mimicking Tern designs but with less premium components and a more mass-market focus.

This is a leading contender for my 5th e-bike, since I still have occasional cargo/hauling needs beyond what I can accomplish with my Q9, and it is so aggressively priced.

### [Gocycle] <a id="gocycle"></a>
Cool sporty/design-y folding ebikes. They seemed a bit expensive and lacking in hauling capacity for what I needed when I demo'd them, but could be good commuter bikes.

### [Qualisports Dolphin] <a id="fiido"></a>
A friend recently got one; it seems like a good commuter bike: cheap ($1400), powerful, has a throttle.

### [Carbo Model X] <a id="carbo-model-x"></a>
They had [a huge crowdfund campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/carbo-the-world-s-lightest-folding-electric-bike#/), and the specs seem like the best of several worlds (folding, lightweight carbon, powerful motor, large battery; an e-folder that's 10lbs lighter than the Brompton, and more powerful).

I was able to test-ride one at [Greenpath] in Brooklyn; I felt like I might miss having multiple gears, and the carbon frame had some flex to it that I found a bit disconcerting. I've heard that low-quality carbon frames can fail in catastrophic ways, so I ultimately decided to let the "carbon e-folder" space mature / dust-settle for a bit before looking at it again. I had recently narrowly missed clicking "buy" on United City Bikes' "The One", which was a similar crowdfunded low-cost carbon e-folder, only to [have them liquidate the company the next day](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedcitybikes/comments/m883o4/unitedcitybikescom_down/grn4t4a) 😭!

Things are moving fast in ebike-land, and there's something to be said for going with reputable brands and stores you can go to for service!

## Ebike Revelations <a id="revelations"></a>
E-biking has made me rethink things about my city, cities in general, mobility as a human need and right, [turbulent flows][cgp-grey-traffic], and more. Here are some things that have struck me in learning to get around by (e)bike:

### Speed ⟹ Safety <a id="speed-safety"></a>
It's counterintuitive, but having access to more speed (and acceleration) can make biking safer. Starting from a stop at lights, holding a lane on shared roads, minimizing the number of cars that close on and overtake you (and the speed they overtake you at)… you are much more in control of your relationship to traffic on an ebike. This is one of new e-bikers' biggest "💡"/"🤯" realizations.

It's also surprising how a little boost makes a *big* difference in your control and safety. Increasing your top speed from 15mph to 20mph means a car going 25mph *passes you half as quickly* and *has twice as much time to "see you coming" as it comes up behind you*.

In more typical urban settings where cars might be averaging 15mph (between 0 and 20mph due to mild congestion and lights), it means you can find one driver who:
1. sees you
2. is not telegraphing their desire to murder you

and draft them for a while (until the next light, when you must bid them "🙏", glide up to the front, and find a new host).

Previously, you had to be a serious cyclist to access this speed (and corresponding ability to simply *exist* on car-dominated roads), but now almost everyone can.

### Speed ⟹ Inclusion <a id="speed-inclusion"></a>
The "Speed ⟹ Safety" effect is particularly true for people who are not stereotypic young/fit men (women, children of all ages, older people, differently abled people, …). I was brave enough – [some of the time][near-misses] – to bike around NYC before e-bikes, but it was not feasible for my wife (though she is in her 30's and reasonably athletic) due to the high baseline level of bullying from drivers (both inadvertent and intentional) as well as specific vitriol and threats she received as a woman taking space that some men motorists feel is theirs.

- In Paris, [the percent of women among new bike-share subscribers rose from 40% to 49%][nextcity.org paris women biking]
- [There's a fascinating history of bicycling + feminism][Bicycling and feminism]
- My 70yo in-laws have been ebike-pilled in their hilly town in Westchester; it's a wonderful way to allow people to get around, get to know their own neighborhoods, get fresh air / exercise, and accomplish daily tasks.

### Speed ⟹ Convenience <a id="speed-convenience"></a>
The most obvious benefit of speed is that it lets you get from A to B faster (or for less work, at a given speed). You can worry less about getting sweaty or feeling like getting home is daunting or you're not up for it, and it's generally easier to go places and do things.

[Class 1 e-bikes][ebike-classes] provide a pedal-assist up to 20mph; this lets casual riders (who normally top out at 12-15mph) play in the 15-20mph range and, as with [the "safety" angle](#safety-speed), that ≈30% difference actually makes for a qualitatively different experience. I consistently pass more cars than pass me. It's pretty hard to go 15-20mph in a car for very long in urban environments, so ebikes are faster for a large class of trips (not even counting time parking).

This is a brand new, developing mode of transportation that changes the basic math of transportation in cities.

### Cost <a id="cost"></a>
On average, [a new car in the US costs $40k][new-car-cost] or [$800/month][car-cost-800-mo].

Lots of the US effectively levies a $40k tax to participate in society, which hits the least well off the hardest. We had a vicious political battle over one-off $1200 COVID relief checks, but enabling people to live car-free is like an $800/mo stimulus in perpetuity.

[80% of car trips are under 5mi][car-trip-length] and easily replaceable by e-bike kits that, on the high end of the market and including [gear and accessories to the max](#gear), cost 1/10th what a car does.

#### 1 car ⟹ 10 e-bikes + gear
When I am passing cars stuck in traffic, a sad realization is that each car could have paid for 10 families' e-bike mobility solutions™️.

Some of the darkest images of the failed state of American governance as well as transportation culture were the long lines of cars at food banks during COVID lockdowns:

[![overhead shot of cars in line at a San Antonio food bank in April 2020, from Reuters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109445173-001d0f00-7a0d-11eb-9d7d-b8c58162dc22.png)

[![overhead shot of cars in line at a San Diego food bank in April 2020, from ABC News](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109445290-44101400-7a0d-11eb-868c-38545f594874.png)](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/covid-19-crisis-heaps-pressure-nation-s-food-banks-n1178731)

### Space <a id="space"></a>
E-bikes take up very little space for the mobility they provide. Mode shift from private cars to e-bikes directly improves a large class of congestion and parking issues in cities.

Taking up less space also means you can bring your bike with you on other modes when necessary (trains, buses, even ride-shares), store it easily, etc.

#### Bike vs. Car Storage <a id="bike-vs-car-storage"></a>
A critical area where American cities fail in enabling biking – and especially e-biking – is providing secure bike parking infrastructure.

[Oonee][oonee] (pronounced "uni") is an NYC-based startup I love, that operates [phone-unlocked pods near transit where a dozen bikes can be stored][oonee pod], and is piloting ["mini" pods that replace single-car parking spots w/ secure storage of 6-10 (e-)bikes][oonee mini].

For comparison, here are some examples of bike parking in other countries that would be a nightmare if replaced with car-parking:

[![car vs. bike parking at Eindhoven station](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125334244-263ab000-e319-11eb-9937-c61885783beb.jpeg)](https://mobile.twitter.com/_dmoser/status/1412013400117362694)

![picture of bike-parking outside a school in the Netherlands](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109443478-a9153b00-7a08-11eb-9076-2c8a4310899c.png)

Compare to car-centric North American analogs:

### Cargo <a id="cargo"></a>
E-bikes can replace cars for a surprising variety of cargo-hauling tasks:

#### Groceries, Bulk Items <a id="groceries"></a>
There is a small (but growing), dedicated group of people that love to show off the things they haul on their (e-)bikes, that I recommend checking out (images link to tweets):

[![Tern GSD with a huge amount of groceries on the front and back](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109440506-854df700-7a00-11eb-8474-d96342f7828c.png)

](https://twitter.com/fighterkites/status/1400141235558432769)

#### Kids <a id="kids"></a>
Even my X3 (VanMoof's smallest bike) supports [a Yepp child seat][yepp-maxi] (the most popular brand I see used):

![VanMoof X3 with a child seat on the back](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109441255-c6dfa180-7a02-11eb-9b73-d177896842be.png)

Larger bikes can fit 2 on the back easily:

[![Woman biking in heels with two children facing each other and playing "patty cake" on the back of the bike](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109443060-99e1bd80-7a07-11eb-97b7-98d079e9c2e8.png)
](https://twitter.com/christineadair/status/1289669201674690560)

There are also front-loading options ("bakfiets" or "box bikes"):

![Woman cargo-biking in NYC with 2 children in a bakfiet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109441210-9f88d480-7a02-11eb-90a3-90065b0b3b85.png)

[![Cargo bike carrying three children and their bikes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109442955-643cd480-7a07-11eb-8097-677d2e7491ad.jpeg)](https://twitter.com/genepedia/status/1272606386401079296)

](https://twitter.com/jeffnovich/status/1400549753205800963)

Of course, it's possible to do even more with less:

![Woman biking with 4 children on a bicycle – 2 in front, 2 in back](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109441501-61d87b80-7a03-11eb-96d8-46d06703c398.png)

but luckily, new and evolving e-bike technology is making all configurations much, much easier.

Finally, most children are capable of biking themselves to school at a relatively young age, if we kept them safe from drivers; see [re-thinking the school run][school-run] for more discussion.

#### PoV: Grocery Runs <a id="pov-grocery-runs"></a>
My grocery runs since getting an e-bike have also been so surprising and delightful that [I've been documenting them in an album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ASed6bguwTXAXSxt8):

![Groceries on counter-top: bread, soup, sauce, vegetables, cheeses](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/109439533-aca2c500-79fc-11eb-926d-4f2cf9689af1.png)

#### PoV: Moving house <a id="pov-moving-house"></a>
Recently, I moved to my brother's empty apartment for 9d (after a small-chance of COVID exposure, to avoid any risk of exposing my wife).

I packed a comfortable >1wk vacation into 4 bags (2 [panniers](#panniers), 1 bag in front rack, 1 backpack), and [biked, ferried, and biked from Jersey City to the Flatiron][strava-vanmoof-move]:

### *Fun* <a id="fun"></a>
TODO

### Health <a id="health"></a>
TODO

### Car sewers <a id="car-sewers"></a>
Biking in cities makes you realize that roads are terrible *places*. They're noisy, dirty, and dangerous because they are dominated by cars. They're awful to be in or around (unless you're in a car).

Interacting with roads on a bike *feels better* in its own right (in at least medium-dense areas, say): it's easy to see how many more people could do so and, if they did, how everyone would get where they're going more quickly/pleasantly/safely (including those who still need to use private cars for one reason or another).

It also underscores how ill-suited private cars are to urban environments: [watching one double-parked car or truck snarl blocks of traffic](#parking), hearing [horn honks or mufflers that are obnoxious (if not dangerous)](#noise) over [a radius that typically includes 1000's of homes](#honk-density), watching parents+stroller bullied in crosswalks by turning SUVs w/ [head-height grills](#grills), etc.… cars don't work very well in dense areas, and they ruin them for everyone outside them.

I'm sorry to speak so negatively but there is enormous, real, preventable harm happening every day because of the level of car-dependence in the US, and most Americans have never known any kind of modern or functional public transit, so it's important to talk both about how much better we can make things but also what is bad about the status quo that most people don't realize or fully appreciate. The [War on Cars](#war-on-cars) section discusses this with more detail and rigor.

## Getting Started <a id="getting-started"></a>
Everyone's journey will be different, but here are some resources and intermediate steps I've found useful on the way to relying on (e)cycling more:

### Bike Shares <a id="bike-shares"></a>
I [citibiked](https://www.citibikenyc.com/) in NYC and JC for years. I loved it and still love it. Electric-citibike inventory is hitting critical mass, and the system is expanding all the time. I will always keep [an annual Citibike membership][annual Citibike membership] on auto-renew ($179, or less than 2x a monthly MetroCard; still a great value).

There's also an explosion of scooter-shares, moped-shares, on-demand e-bike leasing services, etc. In my experience, most such things are worth signing up for and trying to use a few times, or for a few months, to see how they can fit in to your life.

I "graduated" to owning a bike somewhat accidentally; my local ferry shut down during COVID and I needed to get to a ferry stop in Hoboken (outside the Citibike JC area at the time… [no longer!][jc-hoboken-citibike]). I'd also started to want to do longer rides, and felt constrained by the Citibike network limits.

### Renting <a id="renting"></a>
When I started researching buying bikes, I rented a few bikes from my local [Grove Street Cycles](https://www.grovestreetbicycles.com/). One afternoon on [a modest "hybrid"](https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/escape-2-disc) convinced me that, though I love Citibike, I'd outgrown it more than I realized, and a whole new class of mobility and freedom awaited from owning (vs. renting ≤45mins at a time) a nicer/lighter/faster bike.

I definitely recommend seeing if you can rent a few different kinds of bikes – including e-bikes! – as a way of learning about the options in a way that is more visceral than anything you can get reading reviews.

### Safety <a id="safety"></a>
This is a big topic and I am not an expert. [The League of American Cyclists has many resources and guides you should check out][LoAC-tips].

A few specific safety sub-topics:

#### Stats <a id="stats"></a>
Here are [some NYC DOT stats][NYC DOT crash data]:

[![Bicyclists killed or seriously injured (KSI), total and per 1e7 trips, over time; total is roughly flat around 350/yr, rate drops from 80 per 10MM trips in 2000 to 10 in 2018](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125351401-0a8dd480-e32e-11eb-8e6c-d2652f3f51ed.png)][NYC DOT crash data]
- Bicyclists killed or seriously injured (KSI) is roughly flat since 2000 (around 350/yr)
- The rate (per 10MM trips) dropped from ≈80 in 2000 to ≈10 in 2018

[Wikipedia says][Wiki bicycle safety]:
> In a 2014 analysis, incidence of cycling death took place at a mean rate of 4.7 deaths per 100 million kilometers cycled in the U.S., compared to 1.3 deaths per 100 million kilometers in Germany, 1.0 in the Netherlands, and 1.1 in Denmark.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_safety#cite_note-6) In the United Kingdom, cyclists have half of the rate (killed and serious injury per km) of motorcyclists but eight times the rate for motorists.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_safety#cite_note-7)

#### Speed <a id="safety-speed"></a>
Cities are often the safest places to cycle, because cars aren't going as fast:

[![Probability of pedestrian fatality, when hit by driver, as a function of driver speed: <10% at 30kph, 80% at 50kph, ≈100% at 70kph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125352720-9fdd9880-e32f-11eb-8d3a-0acfcb946277.png)](https://mobile.twitter.com/_dmoser/status/1411555290391224321)

Biking is often safer if you can match the speed of traffic, [which is one reason I feel much safer on ebikes](#speed-safety).

#### Fear <a id="fear"></a>
As I've ridden longer, and as cycling infra has improved around me, I less frequently run into situations that scare me or spike my blood pressure. I've become more deferential to pedestrians and the letter of the prevailing traffic laws. The whole cycling experience has become de-adrenalized a bit.

That's allowed me to notice that *fear* is consistently the reason that I make mistakes, break traffic laws, etc. A driver will do something scary, or I will find myself extremely vulnerable on a road designed for cars, and my priorities shift. I generally don't fault vulnerable road users prioritizing their safety.

#### Riding on sidewalks <a id="riding-on-sidewalks"></a>
Cyclists would rather be on roads than on sidewalks, but will always use sidewalks where roads are not safe.

The solution to sidewalk-riding nuisances is to make roads safe for cycling. Pedestrian/Cyclist conflicts are a distraction from cars' being allocated most public space.

[![Comic showing drivers with plenty of space and pedestrians and cyclists fighting for scraps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125380543-56f20800-e360-11eb-9b80-b0a93d904f21.png)
](https://mobile.twitter.com/_dmoser/status/1405782816386859011)

![comic showing roads full of cars and parking, a family on bikes on a sidewalk, and a driver saying "If you take this parking for a bike lane, where will I park my car?! You're not considering my needs!"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125346318-96503280-e327-11eb-93df-b407b8b26c99.png)

#### Stopping at stop signs + red lights <a id="stopping-at-stops"></a>
Cyclists should stop at stop signs and wait at red lights, but a 250lb cyclist+bike running a stop is very different than a driver doing so (in a 4000lb car with its own climate and sound system, and a 100mph top speed):

- A cyclist slowing (e.g. to yield to any pedestrians present) before rolling through a stop sign at 5mph has similar kinetic energy as a car rolling through a stop at 1mph.
- Cyclist also generally have better situational awareness than a driver, and more at stake (being more vulnerable in the event of a crash).

Several states have ["Idaho stop"][Idaho stop] laws, which allow cyclists to treat stops as yields and lights as stops. These are great, not least of all because they emphasize yielding to pedestrians in a way that gets lost when cyclists have been overlooked (and asked to follow rules made for cars, by default).

#### Braking <a id="braking"></a>
[Sheldon Brown on front brakes][front brakes] is a good read; beginners are taught to be careful with the front brake (left hand), to avoid potentially going over the handlebars. As you get more comfortable riding, you should reincorporate the front brake for maximum stopping power.

#### Helmets <a id="helmets-safety"></a>
- I always ride with a helmet, but a lot of discourse around helmet-wearing involves blaming cyclists who are victims of bad infrastructure and negligent drivers; this distracts from discussion and action around the root issues.
- [Helmets are rare in the best cycling cultures][helmet amsterdam tweet]; they are a symptom of dangerous roads that should be addressed directly.
- Helmets are not designed to protect against collisions with cars, and there is evidence ([1][helmet passing 1], [2][helmet passing 2]) that drivers pass helmet-wearing cyclists more dangerously.
- [Helmet mandates in particular are generally used to discourage and criminalize biking][curbed helmet mandates].
- [50%-70% of all traumatic brain injuries occur in car crashes][streetsblog motorist helmets]; arguably better policy is to require helmet for car occupants:
  [![Image of a helmet-less cyclist riding next to a helmet-wearing motorist, with caption: "½ of all serious injuries happen inside motor vehicles – if you drive a car, wear a helmet!"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110815854-ce037c80-8258-11eb-8f10-76bfaa82cd75.png)][motorist helmets]

See also: [discussion of specific helmets is in the "Gear" section](#helmets).

#### Lights <a id="lights-safety"></a>
Lights are definitely useful for safety; "more" is "merrier" as far as I'm concerned.

Something I like about ebikes is that most of them have integrated lights. Not having to fuss with charging separate lights makes the whole process of riding safely at night much simpler.

See [discussion of specific lights I like in "Gear" below](#lights).

#### Hi-Viz Clothing <a id="hi-viz"></a>
I usually wear [this $15 pink hi-viz vest while riding][amzn pink hi-viz vest]:
![rear GoPro view of me riding electric Brompton on 5th Ave in NYC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125342408-e24ca880-e322-11eb-90bf-42a27013d4df.png)

Drivers seem to mess with me less when I'm wearing hi-viz.

[This Amazon vest][amzn custom hi-viz vest] also lets you print custom images on it:
![blue hi-viz vest with an image of Kermit standing one-legged on a bicycle seat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125342252-a6b1de80-e322-11eb-8b4f-3b6e41d2af25.png)


### Route Planning <a id="route-planning"></a>

#### Street View <a id="street-view"></a>
Google Maps Street View has been indispensable for checking out roads before riding them.

Ironically, it can even help identify when Google Maps directions are sending you somewhere unsafe, like [this 4-lane, 50mph no-shoulder highway][ny22-streetview]:

[![Screenshot of Street View showing the 4-lane, 50mph approach to a bridge on NY-22, a 50mph speed limit, and an SUV parked in the last few feet of shoulder before a bridge railing goes right up to the edge of the lane](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110042517-e1bc5980-7d13-11eb-8580-d5a9bc5a3d81.png)][ny22-streetview]

[That is apparently a "bicycle-friendly road" (and prioritized by Google Maps' biking directions whenever I am planning routes in this area 😱)][ny22-gmaps]:
[![Screenshot of the same road on Google Maps, showing a dotted green line along it and a legend that indicates it is a ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110041735-9ce3f300-7d12-11eb-8c1c-71a31588721f.png)][ny22-gmaps]

I also used Street View extensively when making https://bit.ly/mellowbikewestchester ([discussion below](#mellow-bike-maps)); after a while you can get pretty fast at warping ahead by many increments, zooming in to scan for speed limit signs, and using the map detail in the lower-left to teleport longer distances, but it gets a bit tedious after a while. An interface better tailored to this use case would help.

I've also been surprised not to find any decent map apps that make it easy to see roads' speed-limits at a glance. I suspect the required data may exist in [OSM], but haven't had a chance to explore it much yet.

#### Ride with GPS <a id="ride-with-gps"></a>
https://ridewithgps.com/ is one of the best tools for planning/sharing/discovering bike routes.

For example, [here's someone's route up Manhattan's West Side Highway and looping between the George Washington and Tappan Zee bridges][rwgps-bridge-loop]:

[![Screenshot of a "Ride with GPS" route, showing a map view, elevation over distance, and summary statistics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110040762-4cb86100-7d11-11eb-8728-96871c71d024.png)][rwgps-bridge-loop]

Here is a route I made (and hope to ride soon) that includes 23 NYC bridges (all Manhattan bridges and a few in Brooklyn and Roosevelt/Randall's Islands) and 1 boat:

[![RideWithGPS screenshot showing route around Manhattan, zig-zagging back and forth over bridges](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125381047-3aa29b00-e361-11eb-9d83-de2b1afe96bf.png)
](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/36753944)

#### Strava <a id="strava-route-planning"></a>
Strava also has route-planning features that seem decent; [here's the same "23 Bridges 1 Boat" route](https://www.strava.com/routes/2849702787779782978) on Strava.

Both Strava and RideWithGPS make it easy to export and import things in GPX or other formats, so data portability is easy, which is refreshing.

#### "mellow bike maps" <a id="mellow-bike-maps"></a>
Inspired by [the Chicago "mellow bike map"][mellow-bike-chicago], I made a ["mellow bike Westchester" Google map][mellow-bike-westchester] while staying up there for a few weeks and trying to plan rides (for myself and others less experienced, where it was extra important not to accidentally end up on no-shoulder 45mph roads):

[![Screenshot of Google map of greater Westchester County, NY, with streets color-coded by bike-friendliness](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110040245-78871700-7d10-11eb-93fd-e64988be65c9.png)][mellow-bike-westchester]

## Starter Packs <a id="starter-packs"></a>

### VanMoof X3 ($2k; $3k w/ gear) <a id="vanmoof-x3-pack"></a>
The [VanMoof X3](#x3) is the cheapest of my 3 ebikes, but is the best all-around and my go-to e-bike for trips around greater NYC.

It starts at $2k, but I added:
- VanMoof's 3yr theft+maintenance plan ($590); 
- [front basket][vanmoof front basket] ($89), [back rack][vanmoof rear carrier] ($69)
- 2x[handlebar-mounted "feed bags"][revelate feedbag] ($49ea), 1x["Jerry can" tube-top bag][revelate jerrycan] ($46)
- [fleece-lined pogies][ODIER fleece] ($47) for toasty hands in below-freezing temps (I've only had it during winter months, so far)
- [bungee cable set] ($14) for securing items in the front basket

This $2k-$3k package should let you replace/improve a wide class of trips that you'd otherwise use other modes for. [See my more in-depth review below for more info](#x3). Also, the bike + plan can be financed for $83/mo.

### [RadPower]: <$2k <a id="radpower"></a>
RadPower are a popular brand that [is aggressively targeting a lower-pricepoint, mainstream audience][radpower-150mm]. [My 5th/next e-bike will likely be a RadWagon](#radwagon); they seem to be easy to order online and shipping reasonably quickly.

## Reading <a id="reading"></a>

### [electricbikereview.com](https://electricbikereview.com/) <a id="ebr"></a>
This was consistently one of the highest-quality review sites I saw. I learned to seek them out on a Google results page, or go there directly to search for a specific bike.

They did the best job of showing critical stats about bikes in an easy-to-scan format, especially including stats that the industry is sheepish and user-hostile about (<i>\*ahem\* bike weight \*ahem\*</i>).

Here's are their reviews of [a Creo similar to mine][ebr-creo] and my [Tern Vektron Q9][ebr-q9]. Their brand pages are great too: [the Specialized reviews page][ebr-specialized] was very useful in sorting through a bunch of confusingly-named models.

### [r/ebikes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ebikes/) <a id="r-ebikes"></a>
Nice forum with encouraging/inspirational stories and examples

Vendor-specific subreddits are often, e.g. [r/vanmoof] or [r/brompton].

## Gear / Accessories <a id="gear"></a>
The right add-ons might cost 10-20% what your bike cost, but make it 10x more useful. Understanding the types of gear and accessories – let alone specific models – can be overwhelming.

Before I e-biked, I lived out of a backpack while in+around the city. Getting that weight off of me and onto the bike while in transit has been a huge improvement. The options for letting the bike roll things along with you – from "a purse" up to "several suitcases" – are worth exploring.

### Helmets <a id="helmets"></a>
(See [discussion of helmets from a safety PoV above](#helmets-safety))

I wear [a Lumos light-up helmet][lumos helmet] on all my rides. In the past, I used [this more compact+lightweight Giro helmet][amzn Giro helmet], which I would clip onto a backpack and take on the subway, into the office, etc.

### Racks, Baskets <a id="racks-baskets"></a>
For carrying substantial weight or bulk, a back-wheel rack is the platform you build on. Front baskets/racks also range in size, and can significantly add to your carrying capacity.

- my VanMoof's [front][vanmoof front basket] and [rear racks][vanmoof rear carrier] let me roll [2 large panniers and a tote bag along with me](#pov-moving-house)
- my Tern has a super heavy duty ["Atlas" rack][tern atlas rack] that can hold 2 [panniers][tern bucketload panniers] as well as [a giant Market Basket][tern market basket]; I also put a smaller ["holdem basket"][tern holdem basket] on the front, for [maximum grocery capacity](#pov-grocery-runs).
- I got great use out of a [Topeak "Explorer" rack][topeak explorer rack] on my main non-electric bike (if not buying from the same brand that made your bike, you have to check a little more that things are compatible).

### Bags <a id="bags"></a>
There are a lot of incredible bags you can put on your bike. Panniers are the workhorses, but [Revelate] in particular offers dozens of bag shapes you can put basically anywhere else on your bike based on where they fit and how much capacity you want:

![Revelate image of a dirty touring bike with may bags attached all over](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110191019-79917480-7df4-11eb-9b2a-44f7b6a64135.png)
*this is the bike version of SUV commercials that show ridiculous off-roading the average SUV-owner will never do*

I bought 1 (or [6][revelate feedbag]) of nearly every bag they offer (see [my Creo bikepacking setup above](#creo-bikepacking)), and typically mix-and-match which bags make the most sense on which bikes for a given ride.

Getting weight off of you (esp. your back!) and onto the bike – where it just rolls – is an amazing part of getting around by bike (as opposed to walking or other transit modes where you may sometimes wind up standing).

#### Panniers <a id="panniers"></a>
Panniers are bags you can attach to a rack on the back of your bike, and are a great way to haul stuff by bike:

[![VanMoof X3 outside apartment building with 2 Ortlieb panniers on the back rack](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110146045-1974e100-7da8-11eb-9b80-911e44c17ffd.png)](#pov-moving-house)

[![Tern Vektron Q9 in elevator with two full panniers and front and rear baskets with grocery bags](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110146839-0a426300-7da9-11eb-917a-57c83443d23b.png)](#pov-grocery-runs)

I've tested a few kinds:
- [Ortlieb Back-Roller Classics] ($190/pair, 40L ea) are [a well-regarded set][wirecutter-ortlieb] that I've had the best experience with.
- I have [Tern-brand panniers][tern bucketload panniers] ($200/pair, 24L ea) for [my Tern](#q9), and they work well.
- I ordered [VanMoof panniers][vanmoof-small-panniers] (€78/pair, 18L ea) for [my VanMoof](#x3), but they haven't arrived yet, and the Ortliebs fit and work well (and are larger), so I'm not sure I'll need them.
- I also have a set of [Banjo Brothers Market Panniers] ($120/pair, 24L ea) that I've never really gotten in to using.
- Finally, I got [this backpack that converts to a pannier][backpack-pannier] ($180, 30L), and it's been very useful.

#### Cockpit Bags <a id="cockpit-bags"></a>
I love [Revelate's "Mountain Feedbags"][revelate feedbag]; I've put a pair on most of my bikes:

![Biking on 6th Ave with battery in feedbag charging phone mounted on handlebars](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110157461-31ebf800-7db6-11eb-85e2-cde1656df909.png)

Between them, I'll carry a battery that charges my phone while riding (and [sometimes other fun lights](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110158221-17fee500-7db7-11eb-96bf-cd8e55165742.png), [GoPro batteries](#camera-batteries), etc.), a glasses case, tissues/chapstick/[hand-warmers](#hand-warmers)/snacks ("it's like a deli up here", someone who borrowed my bike said recently), airpods, extra masks, [resealable zip ties][zip ties 8"], etc. They are easily opened and closed with one hand, work on pretty much any bike, and are easy to transfer b/t bikes). Very useful.

#### Top-Tube Bags <a id="top-tube-bags"></a>
[The Revelate Mag-Tank 2000][revelate mag-tank 2000] (and earlier/smaller [Mag-Tank][revelate mag-tank]) are great bags that can sit on top of your top tube and hold lots of good stuff. Sometimes I'll have one up front and another at the base of my seat, and between them store wallet/keys, [cable lock][OTTO cable lock], full flat-change kit (tire levers, spare tube, CO₂ cartridge, multi-tool, patch-kit), etc. They're also easily openable/closeable with one hand, and the magnetic clasp is nice.

#### Back-Rack / Seat Bags <a id="back-bags"></a>
I have used Revelate's [8L "Terrapin"] bag and [16L "Spinelock"] bag; both are great, especially for bulky but lightweight items like clothes.

I've also used a Topeak [Aero Wedge seat bag][Topeak Aero Wedge seat bag] and [MTX Trunk Bag Dx][Topeak MTX Trunk Bag Dx].

### Phone Mounts <a id="phone-mounts"></a>
Having my phone mounted up front on my handlebars has been surprisingly useful. I typically have Google Maps' turn-by-turn directions or [Strava's](#strava) speedometer up while riding:

[![Chest-cam shot of phone mounted on handlebars displaying a Google Map, another e-biker is in front, and the George Washington Bridge is in the background](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110153857-948ec500-7db1-11eb-8fd9-3b13e3d68e5d.png)][strava-ebike-day]

When getting started, you're mostly riding in areas you're less familiar with. Having the map handy helps to not feel lost or get lost, as well as to e.g. find detours if a road doesn't feel safe.

I've exclusively used [Quad Lock] handlebar phone mounts ([the Wirecutter's choice][wirecutter-quadlock]) and associated phone cases. They are good products, though a bit pricier than I'd expect: $60 ["out front PRO" mount][quadlock-out-front-mount], $10 [black plastic "lever"][quadlock-lever] (you'd think you could just replace the included blue one for free…), $30 for [a compatible phone case][quadlock-pixel-5-case] ⟹ $100/bike, and I've outfitted 5 bikes at this point! One-hand releasing is easy and convenient, but getting the right angle to rotate the phone into the mount still takes me a minute (I expect I'll get better at that over time).

### Lights <a id="lights"></a>
You want a white "headlight" facing forward and a red taillight facing backward. There are many options and they're mostly all good. Here are some I've used and like:
- [CYGOLITE Metro Plus][amzn cygolite metro plus] ($46): right head-light
- [CYGOLITE Hotrod][amzn cygolite hotrod] ($40): bright tail light
- [Vont 'Pyro' (set)][amzn vont pyro light] ($14): front+rear, good+cheap
- [KNOG (set)][amzn knog lights] ($29): front+rear, very convenient; plug lights directly in to any USB-A port to charge, easy to clip them to things. Good backups to keep in [a bag](#cockpit-bags)

[My Lumos light-up helmet](#helmets) is also a good light to have (at a higher, more visible location).

#### Party lights <a id="party-lights"></a>
I've also thrown [party][amzn party light] [lights][amzn party light 2] and [wheel lights][amzn wheel lights] on bikes:

![bike with disco lights illuminating pavement around it](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110817750-95fd3900-825a-11eb-8547-1e085421fb26.png)

[You can have a lot of fun in this direction][douglas bike]:

[![Image of bike with color-changing lights along wheels and frame](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110819770-7d8e1e00-825c-11eb-8db7-9b454e9f1884.gif)][douglas bike]

### Locks <a id="locks"></a>
There's no substitute for [secure bike parking infrastructure](#bike-vs-car-storage), but some locks I use that I think are basically good enough for occasional, short, daytime outdoor parking in NYC:
- [Kryptonite U-lock + Cable][amzn kryptonite evolution set]: medium weight, decent security
- [OnGuard U-Lock][amzn onguard]: lighter / more clearance but weaker
- [OTTO cable lock]: compact+light extra security layer, easy to keep a spare in a [tube bag](#top-tube-bags).

Other lock systems worth noting:
- [ABUS frame locks] stay on the bike and seem like a convenient and secure option
- [VanMoofs](#x3) have [an internal lock](#x3-internal-locking) that provides added security.
- [The Wirecutter has a more comprehensive review of the bike lock market][wirecutter bike locks].

People that have to lock bikes outside in cities can use stronger locks – like [Kryptonite's "New York Fahgettaboudit" line][amzn kryptonite new york] – and [heavy chains][kryptonite chain]. However, these are heavy, and [can still be cut][twitter vanmoof theft] by thieves with angle-grinders and time (especially overnight, having observed bikes locked in the same place every night).

Bike theft is clearly organized crime in many cities, but is not something law enforcement seems to spend much energy on. Increasing cooperation between [national bike registries][bike index], [bike insurers](#insurance), and bike- and lock-manufacturers (adding location-tracking to bikes and even [sending their own teams to find them][vanmoof bike hunters]) will hopefully improve this in the future.

#### Insurance <a id="insurance"></a>
I got [Velosurance], on a recommendation from a friend whose family e-bikes in Jersey City; he said:

> I fear theft but I purchased an insurance policy from Velosurance. This helps me sleep at night; as long as I've locked the bike to a fixed object, I'm covered. You should think about it.

My monthly quotes were around 1/300th the bike's cost, or 4% / 1/25th per year, which was cheaper than I expected! Thankfully, I haven't had to use it yet, but having it has given me peace of mind.

### Misc. Accessories <a id="misc-accessories"></a>
- Bells: [this $6 Amazon bell][amzn bell] has worked well for me 3x. I also got [a Spurcycle][spurcycle-bell] ($49) after hearing that it is the best, but I think I prefer the Amazon one 🤷🏼‍♂️.
- Hand Pump: [this one][amzn pump] is super compact + light and contains a hose w/ presta and schrader nozzles
- Kickstand: [this two-legged style of kickstand][amzn kickstand] is sturdy and easy to deal with
- Rear-View Mirrors: [I have this one][amzn mirror] and [this one][amzn mirror 2] mounted on handlebars on 2 different bikes.
  ![cockpit view of Creo roadbike with mirror attached to end of left drop-bar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125354934-64909900-e332-11eb-8733-4fc82b19bd60.png)

### Gloves <a id="gloves"></a>
In warmer months, I wear ["MOREOK" gloves][amzn MOREOK gloves] ($17) on most rides. Some light gel-padding is nice on hands/wrists during longer rides.

In colder months, [Brooks LSD Thermal Gloves][Brooks gloves] ($50) are great touchscreen gloves with retractable, waterproof mitten covers. I can use my phone at like 90% with them, but they're also pretty warm with mitten covers pulled over. I've used them below freezing (mid/high 20ºF's) by putting [hand warmers](#hand-warmers) in the palm or mitten cover parts; wearing them inside [pogies](#pogies) is an even warmer+easier setup. They're very light and easily crumple/fold into small pocket spaces, so I keep them on me ≈6mos/yr.

See also [Winter Cycling Gear](#winter-cycling-gear) below for [heated glove](#heated-gloves) and [pogie](#pogies) recs.

### Rain gear <a id="rain-gear"></a>
I got some [Clever Hood "Rover" Capes] and they seem good, though I haven't used them a ton / haven't 100% integrated them into my routine yet. People I follow swear by them, and I basically get the vision of a well-designed + reliable "protection from wind+elements" system. They pack down well, so I bring them along as mix of a rain / optional-warmth layer sometimes.

### Winter Cycling Gear <a id="winter-cycling-gear"></a>
I grew up in Miami and have bad hands/feet circulation. I don't like the cold and I'm bad at it. Biking in cold weather (let alone cold rain/snow) generally sounds miserable to most people.

It turns out a a few $100 of gear and technology basically solves this problem. Whether you winter cycle or not, you should probably buy [heated gloves](#heated-gloves), [socks](#heated-socks), and [a vest](#heated-vests). My recs are below.

#### Aside: it's not *that* cold a lot of the time
I think people think it's colder in greater NYC more of the time [than it is](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/nyregion/climate-change-nyc.html). [January is the coldest month in NYC (avg daily hi/lo 39°/26°F)](https://share.getcloudapp.com/NQuKnNmj); for sure there are days and times when it is annoying to go out, but for the price of a couple car payments you can move that from "days under 50°F" (several months of the year) to "days under 30°F" (odd days here and there).

In the winter, cars often function as ["2 ton, internal combustion parkas"][ice-parkas]. Clearly they maximize internal comfort for riders, but they also [externalize a variety of costs][auto-externalities]. It turns out it's not *that* hard to keep warm in most situations while traveling more efficiently.

#### Heated Gloves <a id="heated-gloves"></a>
This winter I discovered heated gloves, and they are amazing (though also less necessary once I got [pogies](#pogies)):
- [VELAZZIO Thermo1 Battery Heated Gloves][velazzio gloves] ($90-10%):
  - These are my go-tos: charge via USB-C, sleek form factor, good warmth.
  - Below freezing (and without pogies), I wear them over my thin Brooks gloves, and put them on high.
  - Sizes run large (I got a "S" for my wife (5'4") but they ended up fitting me (6')), underside of button can borderline-overheat against bare hand on "high" setting
- [LUWATT Heated Gloves][luwatt gloves] ($50): good all-around, but became backups/loaners for me behind the Velazzio's above (a bit bulkier?)
- [Volt WOMENS 7V ALL PURPOSE HEATED GLOVES][volt gloves] ($150): after the "S" Velazzio's were huge, I found this higher-end brand that made me believe their palm measurements etc. were actually accurate. Size "S" does fit women 5'2"-5'4" I ride with. They generally seem sleek and good.

#### Heated Vests <a id="heated-vests"></a>
[This ARRIS Heated Vest][arris-vest-men] ($139 - $10 coupon; also [women's version][arris-vest-women]) is an excellent accesory, and dramatically changes what it's like to go out in the cold:
- 3 independent heat toggles for chest, stomach, and back+neck, and 5 heat levels on each.
- Comfortable, feels high-quality.
- Great zippered-pocket design.

Pushing buttons on the vest lets you control your core temperature across a ≈50ºF range without carrying bulky layers, and the 4 pockets are really useful. Highly recommended.

#### Pogies <a id="pogies"></a>
I started with [these neoprene ODIER's][ODIER neoprene] and found them to be a revelation. Later I upgraded to [these fleece ODIER's][ODIER fleece] and they are incredibly warm and nice. My hands always limit how cold I can be outside, and these completely solved that problem (I rode comfortably down to about 20℉; and other things start to limit me at that point).

#### Heated Socks <a id="heated-socks"></a>
I've bought heated socks from [Binnice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DKR47QP/) ($36) and [Jomst](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GK7PVFJ/) ($38). In both cases, I have barely been able to feel the heat they generate, even on the "high" settings. It's possible they're still helping, but a bit strange since the [gloves](#heated-gloves)/[vests](#heated-vests) I've tried are unmistakably warm.

#### Hand Warmers <a id="hand-warmers">
I have [a 40-pair box of disposable hand warmers][hand-warmers-box], and keep 3 pairs in a side pocket of my [handlebar bags](#cockpit-bags) when it's cold out (just in case). They're a good fail-safe if [heated gloves](#heated-gloves) or [socks](#heated-socks) aren't enough (or you didn't think you'd need them). Supposedly you can "recharge" them with boiling water, so as to avoid single-use waste, though I've not tried that.

### Action Cameras <a id="action-cameras"></a>
I film basically all my ride with 2 GoPros: [one chest-mounted, one rear-facing, seat-rail mounted](#camera-mounts). They're mostly a nice-to-have safety measure (though presumably only useful if something truly horrible happens 😔), but some of my rides also feel like incredible ways to see the city, and [I am working on processing+sharing them](#post-processing) in ways that convey that. They're also useful for [mundane documentation of road conditions][SCF 10th st pothole], [filing 311 tickets][hoboken xwalk tweet], etc. One day last winter, I lost a glove on a ride, and [was able to find on my tapes where it had popped out of my front basket](https://www.strava.com/activities/4638483151).

[![Cockpit view showing extra glove falling out of basket onto road while hitting a pothole](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125384395-dda9e380-e366-11eb-9c89-48c16df8fdf6.png)
](https://photos.app.goo.gl/gDTbMgUbVnxDDBv4A)

We went back the next day, and someone had put it up more visibly:
![Lost glove on a mailbox near where it was lost](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125384578-1fd32500-e367-11eb-878b-72497a0fa48c.png)

My GoPros are a [Hero 9][GoPro Hero 9 Black] and a [Hero 8][GoPro Hero 8 Black], and I choose which one faces forward vs. backward each ride (rear-cam gets good front-on shots of people I'm riding with, so sometimes I'll put the higher-quality Hero 9 back there, otherwise I face it forward to get the best shots of what I'm seeing). The Hero 9 is the latest GoPro, and seems noticeably better than the [Hero 8][GoPro Hero 8 Black]; it has a bigger battery, supposedly better stabilization, and can sit on my desk with no battery in for longer before [resetting its date+time to 1/1/2016](https://community.gopro.com/t5/Cameras/Hero-9-Date-amp-amp-Time-defaults-to-1-1-2016/td-p/783025). Both are much better than the [Hero 5 Session][GoPro Hero 5 Session] I started with.

#### Batteries <a id="camera-batteries"></a>
I have ended up with 5 batteries and 2 2-battery chargers for each of my GoPros:

![GoPro Hero 8 and 9 cameras and 5 batteries – including 2 2-battery chargers – for each](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110830639-6dc80700-8267-11eb-855f-6f949a376f5d.png)
(*[this 3x-USB-C cable][amzn 3xUSB-C cable] is handy*)

I get ≈90mins of film time per battery at 1080p24, so swapping batteries on longer rides is common. It's a bit annoying to have to pay attention to, but I guess it also ensures I don't go too long without a break / sip of water.

#### Camera Mounting <a id="camera-mounting"></a>
I keep one of [these quick-release "J-hooks" on each camera][amzn j-hooks]:

[![GoPro "quick-release" / "J-hook"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110822520-25a4e680-825f-11eb-9678-9a43923467c8.png)][amzn j-hooks]

…and [a corresponding quick-release plate][amzn tripod adapter] anywhere that I need to mount them:

[![quick-release plate with screws underneath](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110822710-54bb5800-825f-11eb-9f05-45d5727e0fa4.png)][amzn tripod adapter]

My chest harness came in [this $30, 50pc gear kit][amzn gopro kit], and my seat-rail mount [involves several more adapters than one might hope](https://www.reddit.com/r/gopro/comments/ntq8nv/rgopro_weekly_questions_thread_ask_all_of_your/h1vtohq):

![Schematic of a seat-rail GoPro mount and various adapters to give me a permanent "quick-release" buckle on my bikes, that I can quickly clip cameras into and out of](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125383366-4beda680-e365-11eb-889c-8c841c4a7dca.png)

I also have several tripods for stationary filming ([small][amzn small tripod], [large][amzn large tripod], [foldy][amzn foldy tripod]).

### Padded Shorts <a id="padded-shorts"></a>
I often wear [BALEAF padded bike shorts][amzn BALEAF shorts] ($29); padded shorts seemed a little silly at first, but they're pretty good for biking but also misc other outdoor activities. I got some baggy swimsuit-style padded shorts and some spandex-y ones like this, and liked the latter better. The pockets on these are great as well. As it cooled down, I would wear them over tights.

## Documenting Rides <a id="documenting-rides"></a>
I've enjoyed tracking and documenting my rides on a few services:

### Strava <a id="strava"></a>
I really like [Strava](strava.com) for recording and sharing rides. I pay them an annual fee, the app is well built, and they don't try to own my data in any way. It is also serves as a nice shared-interest-driven social network.

### [wandrer.earth](https://wandrer.earth/) <a id="wandrer.earth"></a>
This is an app I love that lives on top of Strava's API, imports your Strava history, and gives you cool statistics and visualizations about where you've been.

The "[Big Map](https://wandrer.earth/dashboard/map#7.75/40.618/-73.792)" is one of the main attractions:

![Map of places I've explored in NYC, NJ, Westchester County, and Connecticut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/125385676-f1564980-e368-11eb-95c0-0f844dbedaae.png)

I have a shortcut to this page on my phone home screen. On some rides I leave it open and use it to navigate in real-time, trying to ride as many new/unexplored roads as possible. It's really fun and a cool way to explore an area.

wandrer.earth also showcases some good open-data norms in the apps people use for these purposes; it sits on top of Strava and provides some additional, more niche features that I also pay for (separate from my underlying Strava subscription). After all the perversity of consumers' relationships to big, ad-driven tech co's, there's something nice about having these clear, transactional relationships with developers making useful apps but not trying to own me or my data or my eyeballs!

### YouTube <a id="youtube"></a>
I've posted a few ride videos to [a Neighbor Ryan YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUEDi4kDGExvmx0g0gkVwkA/videos).

### Post-Processing Videos <a id="post-processing"></a>
When you start filming rides (cf. ["Action Cameras"](#action-cameras)), you'll quickly generate huge amounts of data. My GoPro can shoot 4K60, but I learned the hard way to ratchet down to 1080p24. GoPros cut shots into 4GB "chapters" (≈11mins at that resolution). My laptop's 1TB SSD could hold ≈45hrs of this "low"-res video (if I had nothing else on it).

#### External SSDs <a id="ssds"></a>
I started with [a 1TB external SSD][amzn 1TB SSD] and added [a 2TB][amzn 2TB SSD] later. These things are pretty incredible, they fit in your palm:

#### Wasabi Cloud Storage <a id="wasabi"></a>
Eventually I filled up the 2TB too, and started putting data in [Wasabi][wasabi] (cheap cloud storage w/ good tooling). I'm stil in the free trial, but planning to use it as my canonical/archival store going forward, script moving new videos there automatically, and setting up downstream pipelines. My SSDs are not backed up anywhere so they might become an [LRU cache] of data in Wasabi. Given the price points, I'd rather pay-as-I-go on Wasabi than capacity-plan and deploy a RAID array on my desk 😁.

#### 512GB micro-SIM <a id="sim"></a>
In some sense the most absurd piece of technology I use is [this 512GB micro-SIM][amzn 512GB micro-SIM] that the GoPro records to:

![side-by-side of a 512GB micro-SIM card and a quarter (the latter about 3x the size)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/465045/110189779-55329980-7dee-11eb-9560-d058743ed859.png)
*where does all that data go…? 🤯*

I started with smaller SIMs, but worrying about the camera card's capacity was too annoying (on top of juggling battery + spares and archival storage capacity post-ride), and ultimately solvable for $75.

#### VFX Suites <a id="vfx"></a>
I resisted using proper VFX suites to process my GoPro videos for a long time, but ultimately caved, bought [Final Cut Pro][fcp], and have been learning to use it. It does a good job abstracting over the 4GB GoPro "chapter" files that every shot is broken into, and is easy to use for speeding up / cutting video. The export flows are a bit clunky (videos as `.mov` only, frames as `.tiff`; I'm sure I'm missing things…) and I already want to script things on top of it, but it's a good start and very powerful beyond what I've learned.

https://goprotelemetryextractor.com/ seems good and able to deal with GoPro GPS/speed/etc. (which I've also not cracked in FCP).

I used to use GoPro's "Quik" app just for an auto-import when I plug my SIM in; I never found the VFX features usable. I've since given up on it altogether.
