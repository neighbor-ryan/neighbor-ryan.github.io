# E-bikes are a Transportation Revolution
I bought an e-bike in November, it was life-changing, and now I have 4 (all pedal-assist, not throttle).

I've incepted friends and family with e-bike mania and am overwhelmed with e-bikes' potential to improve the lives of millions of people who don't realize it yet.

I'm documenting my journey and reflections about the e-bike space in the hope it will help others.

<!-- ## Proselytization

### War on Cars <a id="war-on-cars"></a>

#### Parking
(multiple economic sectors now involve near-constant double-parking, because for some reason we decided that >50% of every street should be free car storage), 

#### Noise
sonyc
horns are loud
(and buck all other social norms around acceptable levels of noise pollution) of The obnoxiousness-radius honks are disruptive
